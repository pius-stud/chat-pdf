(2021).The NLP landscape has recently been revolutionized by\\nlanguage models (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019;\\nBrown et al., 2020, inter alia ). Scaling up the size of lan-\\nguage models has been shown to confer a range of beneﬁts,\\nsuch as improved performance and sample efﬁciency (Ka-\\nplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020, inter alia ). However,\\nscaling up model size alone has not proved sufﬁcient for\\nachieving high performance on challenging tasks such as\\narithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Rae\\net al., 2021).\\nThis work explores how the reasoning ability of large\\nlanguage models can be unlocked by a simple method\\nmotivated by two ideas. First, techniques for arithmetic\\nreasoning can beneﬁt from generating natural language\\nrationales that lead to the ﬁnal answer. Prior work has\\ngiven models the ability to generate natural language inter-\\nmediate steps by training from scratch (Ling et al., 2017)\\nor ﬁnetuning a pretrained model (Cobbe et al., 2021), in\\naddition to neuro-symbolic methods that use formal lan-\\nguages instead of natural language (Roy and Roth, 2015;\\nChiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al.,\\n2019). Second, large language models offer the exciting\\nprospect of in-context few-shot learning via prompting . That is, instead of ﬁnetuning a separate\\nlanguage model checkpoint for each new task, one can simply “prompt” the model with a few\\ninput–output exemplars demonstrating the task. Remarkably, this has been successful for a range of\\nsimple question-answering tasks (Brown et al., 2020).\\nBoth of the above ideas, however, have key limitations. For rationale-augmented training and\\nﬁnetuning methods, it is costly to create a large set of high quality rationales, which is much more\\ncomplicated than simple input–output pairs used in normal machine learning. For the traditional few-\\nshot prompting method used in Brown et al. (2020), it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning\\nabilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale (Rae et al.,\\n2021). In this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning\\ntasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: hinput, chain of thought , outputi. Achain of thought is\\na series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal output, and we refer to\\nthis approach as chain-of-thought prompting . An example prompt is shown in Figure 1.\\nWe present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks,\\nshowing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking\\ndegree. Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems\\n(Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting\\nby a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. A prompting only approach is\\nimportant because it does not require a large training dataset and because a single model checkpoint\\ncan perform many tasks without loss of generality. This work underscores how large language models\\ncan learn via a few examples with natural language data about the task (c.f. automatically learning\\nthe patterns underlying inputs and outputs via a large training dataset).\\n2 Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nConsider one’s own thought process when solving a complicated reasoning task such as a multi-step\\nmath word problem. It is typical to decompose the problem into intermediate steps and solve each\\nbefore giving the ﬁnal answer: “After Jane gives 2 ﬂowers to her mom she has 10 :::then after she\\ngives 3 to her dad she will have 7 :::so the answer is 7. ” The goal of this paper is to endow language\\nmodels with the ability to generate a similar chain of thought —a coherent series of intermediate\\nreasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal answer for a problem. We will show that sufﬁciently large\\n2', doc_id='45d4e2ca-b23c-40b4-80c9-b69edd5682bf', embedding=None, doc_hash='7778451b1e7bb41b6be219026f9529d567f51a4f81704de4bd5b45b840d5cf5c', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='language models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the ﬁnal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model’s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in sufﬁciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁnetuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following ﬁve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input–output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting—Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.)

A: The coin was flipped by Maybelle. So the coin was flipped 1 time, which is an odd number. The coin started heads up, so after an odd number of flips, it will be tails up.

For AQuA, we used four exemplars\\nand solutions from the training set, as given in Appendix Table 21.\\nLanguage models. We evaluate ﬁve large language models. The ﬁrst is GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\\n2020), for which we use text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, and text-davinci-002, which\\npresumably correspond to InstructGPT models of 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B parameters (Ouyang\\net al., 2022).The second is LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), which has models of 422M, 2B, 8B,\\n68B, and 137B parameters. The third is PaLM , which has models of 8B, 62B, and 540B parameters.\\nThe fourth is UL2 20B (Tay et al., 2022), and the ﬁfth is Codex (Chen et al., 2021, code-davinci-002\\nin the OpenAI API). We sample from the models via greedy decoding (though follow-up work shows\\nchain-of-thought prompting can be improved by taking the majority ﬁnal answer over many sampled\\ngenerations (Wang et al., 2022a)). For LaMDA, we report averaged results over ﬁve random seeds,\\nwhere each seed had a different randomly shufﬂed order of exemplars. As LaMDA experiments\\ndid not show large variance among different seeds, to save compute we report results for a single\\nexemplar order for all other models.\\n3.2 Results\\nThe strongest results of chain-of-thought prompting are summarized in Figure 4, with all experimental\\noutputs for each model collection, model size, and benchmark shown in Table 2 in the Appendix.\\nThere are three key takeaways. First, Figure 4 shows that chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent\\nability of model scale (Wei et al., 2022b). That is, chain-of-thought prompting does not positively\\nimpact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of\\n\\x18100B parameters. We qualitatively found that models of smaller scale produced ﬂuent but illogical\\nchains of thought, leading to lower performance than standard prompting.\\n4', doc_id='ec82528c-2005-4abe-ba0b-21010c456123', embedding=None, doc_hash='3fd24529a0e6dbf3f3ac5569ca2c9409ca08a46fcca48aed614ef43d9fc8c904', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='0204060GSM8K\\nsolve rate (%)LaMDA GPT PaLMStandard prompting\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nPrior supervised best\\n020406080SV AMP\\nsolve rate (%)\\n0.4 81370255075100MAWPS\\nsolve rate (%)\\n0.4 7175 862540\\nModel scale (# parameters in billions)\\nFigure 4: Chain-of-thought prompting enables\\nlarge language models to solve challenging math\\nproblems. Notably, chain-of-thought reasoning\\nis an emergent ability of increasing model scale.\\nPrior best numbers are from Cobbe et al. (2021)\\nfor GSM8K, Jie et al. (2022) for SV AMP, and Lan\\net al. (2021) for MAWPS.Second, chain-of-thought prompting has larger\\nperformance gains for more-complicated prob-\\nlems. For instance, for GSM8K (the dataset\\nwith the lowest baseline performance), perfor-\\nmance more than doubled for the largest GPT\\nand PaLM models. On the other hand, for Sin-\\ngleOp, the easiest subset of MAWPS which only\\nrequires a single step to solve, performance im-\\nprovements were either negative or very small\\n(see Appendix Table 3).\\nThird, chain-of-thought prompting via GPT-3\\n175B and PaLM 540B compares favorably to\\nprior state of the art, which typically ﬁnetunes a\\ntask-speciﬁc model on a labeled training dataset.\\nFigure 4 shows how PaLM 540B uses chain-of-\\nthought prompting to achieve new state of the art\\non GSM8K, SV AMP, and MAWPS (though note\\nthat standard prompting already passed the prior\\nbest for SV AMP). On the other two datasets,\\nAQuA and ASDiv, PaLM with chain-of-thought\\nprompting reaches within 2% of the state of the\\nart (Appendix Table 2).\\nTo better understand why chain-of-thought\\nprompting works, we manually examined model-\\ngenerated chains of thought by LaMDA 137B\\nfor GSM8K. Of 50 random examples where the\\nmodel returned the correct ﬁnal answer, all of\\nthe generated chains of thought were also log-\\nically and mathematically correct except two\\nthat coincidentally arrived at the correct answer\\n(see Appendix D.1, and Table 8 for examples\\nof correct model-generated chains of thought).\\nWe also randomly examined 50 random sam-\\nples for which the model gave the wrong answer.\\nThe summary of this analysis is that 46% of the\\nchains of thought were almost correct, barring\\nminor mistakes (calculator error, symbol map-\\nping error, or one reasoning step missing), and that the other 54% of the chains of thought had major\\nerrors in semantic understanding or coherence (see Appendix D.2). To provide a small insight into\\nwhy scaling improves chain-of-thought reasoning ability, we performed a similar analysis of errors\\nmade by PaLM 62B and whether those errors were ﬁxed by scaling to PaLM 540B. The summary\\nis that scaling PaLM to 540B ﬁxes a large portion of one-step missing and semantic understanding\\nerrors in the 62B model (see Appendix A.1).\\n3.3 Ablation Study\\nThe observed beneﬁts of using chain-of-thought prompting raises the natural question of whether the\\nsame performance improvements can be conferred via other types of prompting. Figure 5 shows an\\nablation study with three variations of chain of thought described below.\\nEquation only. One reason for why chain-of-thought prompting might help is that it produces the\\nmathematical equation to be evaluated, and so we test a variation where the model is prompted\\nto output only a mathematical equation before giving the answer. Figure 5 shows that equation\\nonly prompting does not help much for GSM8K, which implies that the semantics of the questions\\nin GSM8K are too challenging to directly translate into an equation without the natural language\\nreasoning steps in chain of thought. For datasets of one-step or two-step problems, however, we ﬁnd\\nthat equation only prompting does improve performance, since the equation can be easily derived\\nfrom the question (see Appendix Table 6).\\n5', doc_id='ab7c247a-d40d-4db4-ba2a-d9b162a26c1b', embedding=None, doc_hash='a2549f9f47aaab9eced4a87a3096cfc0a738c72e45d0073994579daef6b19883', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='LaMDA PaLM0204060GSM8K solve rate (%)Standard prompting\\nEquation only\\nVariable compute only\\nReasoning after answer\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nFigure 5: Ablation study for dif-\\nferent variations of prompting us-\\ning LaMDA 137B and PaLM 540B.\\nResults for other datasets are given\\nin Appendix Table 6 and Table 7.Variable compute only. Another intuition is that chain of\\nthought allows the model to spend more computation (i.e.,\\nintermediate tokens) on harder problems. To isolate the effect\\nof variable computation from chain-of-thought reasoning, we\\ntest a conﬁguration where the model is prompted to output a\\nonly sequence of dots ( :::) equal to the number of characters in\\nthe equation needed to solve the problem. This variant performs\\nabout the same as the baseline, which suggests that variable\\ncomputation by itself is not the reason for the success of chain-\\nof-thought prompting, and that there appears to be utility from\\nexpressing intermediate steps via natural language.\\nChain of thought after answer. Another potential beneﬁt of\\nchain-of-thought prompting could simply be that such prompts\\nallow the model to better access relevant knowledge acquired\\nduring pretraining. Therefore, we test an alternative conﬁgura-\\ntion where the chain of thought prompt is only given after the\\nanswer, isolating whether the model actually depends on the\\nproduced chain of thought to give the ﬁnal answer. This variant\\nperforms about the same as the baseline, which suggests that\\nthe sequential reasoning embodied in the chain of thought is\\nuseful for reasons beyond just activating knowledge.\\n3.4 Robustness of Chain of Thought\\nGSM8K05101520Solve rate (%)Standard prompting\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\n\\x01different annotator (B)\\n\\x01different annotator (C)\\n\\x01intentionally concise style\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\x0b)\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\x0c)\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\r)\\nMAWPS0204060\\nFigure 6: Chain-of-thought prompting\\nhas variance for different prompt exam-\\nples (as expected) but outperforms stan-\\ndard prompting for various annotators as\\nwell as for different exemplars.Sensitivity to exemplars is a key consideration of prompt-\\ning approaches—for instance, varying the permutation of\\nfew-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy of GPT-3 on\\nSST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near state of\\nthe art (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).

In addition to the results above,\\nwhich used chains of thought written by an Annotator\\nA, two other co-authors of this paper (Annotators B and\\nC) independently wrote chains of thought for the same\\nfew-shot exemplars (shown in Appendix H). Annotator A\\nalso wrote another chain of thought that was more concise\\nthan the original, following the style of solutions given in\\nCobbe et al.

So there are 9 + 20 = 29\\nnew computers in the server room now” .\\n6', doc_id='b1864a01-275b-45de-9688-f2e66d700e77', embedding=None, doc_hash='05d0f93532d723720f5e935824226a826cb881239ae1f87572295282b155ed2a', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='source (examples in this dataset already included reasoning steps like a chain of thought).2Fig-\\nure 6 shows that these prompts performed comparably with our manually written exemplars, also\\nsubstantially outperforming standard prompting.\\nIn addition to robustness to annotators, independently-written chains of thought, different exemplars,\\nand various language models, we also ﬁnd that chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic reasoning\\nis robust to different exemplar orders and varying numbers of exemplars (see Appendix A.2).\\n4 Commonsense Reasoning\\nAlthough chain of thought is particularly suitable for math word problems, the language-based nature\\nof chain of thought actually makes it applicable to a broad class of commonsense reasoning problems,\\nwhich involve reasoning about physical and human interactions under the presumption of general\\nbackground knowledge. Commonsense reasoning is key for interacting with the world and is still\\nbeyond the reach of current natural language understanding systems (Talmor et al., 2021).\\nBenchmarks. We consider ﬁve datasets covering a diverse range of commonsense reasoning types.\\nThe popular CSQA (Talmor et al., 2019) asks commonsense questions about the world involving\\ncomplex semantics that often require prior knowledge. StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) requires\\nmodels to infer a multi-hop strategy to answer questions. We choose two specialized evaluation sets\\nfrom the BIG-bench effort (BIG-bench collaboration, 2021): Date Understanding, which involves\\ninferring a date from a given context, and Sports Understanding, which involves determining whether\\na sentence relating to sports is plausible or implausible. Finally, the SayCan dataset (Ahn et al.,\\n2022) involves mapping a natural language instruction to a sequence of robot actions from a discrete\\nset. Figure 3 shows examples with chain of thought annotations for all datasets.\\nPrompts. We follow the same experimental setup as the prior section. For CSQA and StrategyQA,\\nwe randomly selected examples from the training set and manually composed chains of thought for\\nthem to use as few-shot exemplars. The two BIG-bench tasks do not have training sets, so we selected\\nthe ﬁrst ten examples as exemplars in the evaluation set as few-shot exemplars and report numbers on\\nthe rest of the evaluation set. For SayCan, we use six examples from the training set used in Ahn et al.\\n(2022) and also manually composed chains of thought.\\nResults. Figure 7 highlights these results for PaLM (full results for LaMDA, GPT-3, and different\\nmodel scales are shown in Table 4). For all tasks, scaling up model size improved the performance\\nof standard prompting; chain-of-thought prompting led to further gains, with improvements appear-\\ning to be largest for PaLM 540B. With chain-of-thought prompting, PaLM 540B achieved strong\\nperformance relative to baselines, outperforming the prior state of the art on StrategyQA (75.6% vs\\n69.4%) and outperforming an unaided sports enthusiast on sports understanding (95.4% vs 84%).\\nThese results demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting can also improve performance on tasks\\nrequiring a range of commonsense reasoning abilities (though note that gain was minimal on CSQA).\\n86254020406080100 Solve rate (%)CSQA\\n8625405060708090StrategyQA\\nStandard prompting\\nChain of thought\\nPrior supervised best\\nHuman\\n862540020406080\\nModel scale (# parameters in billions)Date\\n862540406080100Sports\\n86254020406080100SayCan\\nFigure 7: Chain-of-thought prompting also improves the commonsense reasoning abilities of\\nlanguage models.

We show that chain-of-\\nthought prompting not only enables language models to\\nperform symbolic reasoning tasks that are challenging in\\nthe standard prompting setting, but also facilitates length\\ngeneralization to inference-time inputs longer than those\\nseen in the few-shot exemplars.\\nTasks. We use the following two toy tasks.\\n•Last letter concatenation. This task asks the model\\nto concatenate the last letters of words in a name (e.g.,\\n“Amy Brown”!“yn” ). It is a more challenging version\\nof ﬁrst letter concatenation, which language models can\\nalready perform without chain of thought.3We generate\\nfull names by randomly concatenating names from the\\ntop one-thousand ﬁrst and last names from name census\\ndata ( https://namecensus.com/ ).\\n•Coin ﬂip. This task asks the model to answer whether a\\ncoin is still heads up after people either ﬂip or don’t ﬂip\\nthe coin (e.g., “A coin is heads up. Phoebe ﬂips the coin.\\nOsvaldo does not ﬂip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?”\\n!“no” ).\\nAs the construction of these symbolic reasoning tasks is\\nwell-deﬁned, for each task we consider an in-domain test\\nset for which examples had the same number of steps as\\nthe training/few-shot exemplars, as well as an out-of-domain (OOD) test set, for which evaluation\\nexamples had more steps than those in the exemplars. For last letter concatenation, the model only\\nsees exemplars of names with two words, and then performs last letter concatenation on names with 3\\nand 4 words.4We do the same for the number of potential ﬂips in the coin ﬂip task. Our experimental\\nsetup uses the same methods and models as in the prior two sections. We again manually compose\\nchains of thought for the few-shot exemplars for each task, which are given in Figure 3.\\nResults. The results of these in-domain and OOD evaluations are shown in Figure 8 for PaLM,\\nwith results for LaMDA shown in Appendix Table 5. With PaLM 540B, chain-of-thought prompting\\nleads to almost 100% solve rates (note that standard prompting already solves coin ﬂip with PaLM\\n540, though not for LaMDA 137B). Note that these in-domain evaluations are “toy tasks” in the\\nsense that perfect solution structures are already provided by the chains of thought in the few-shot\\nexemplars; all the model has to do is repeat the same steps with the new symbols in the test-time\\nexample. And yet, small models still fail—the ability to perform abstract manipulations on unseen\\nsymbols for these three tasks only arises at the scale of 100B model parameters.\\nAs for the OOD evaluations, standard prompting fails for both tasks. With chain-of-thought prompting,\\nlanguage models achieve upward scaling curves (though performance is lower than in the in-domain\\nsetting). Hence, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of\\nthought for language models of sufﬁcient scale.\\n6 Discussion\\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple mechanism for eliciting multi-step rea-\\nsoning behavior in large language models. We ﬁrst saw that chain-of-thought prompting improves\\nperformance by a large margin on arithmetic reasoning, yielding improvements that are much stronger\\nthan ablations and robust to different annotators, exemplars, and language models (Section 3). Next,\\n3We tested 10 common names using GPT-3 davinci and it got all but one correct.\\n4For names of length longer than 2 words, we concatenate multiple ﬁrst and last names together.\\n8', doc_id='884c2a8e-e557-40f1-bc51-90dfda2c082d', embedding=None, doc_hash='dc8a4aa833ddaed440953b79461749a465fbbaf92f817e84cfdc2b9b4f6b9c09', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='experiments on commonsense reasoning underscored how the linguistic nature of chain-of-thought\\nreasoning makes it generally applicable (Section 4). Finally, we showed that for symbolic reasoning,\\nchain-of-thought prompting facilitates OOD generalization to longer sequence lengths (Section 5). In\\nall experiments, chain-of-thought reasoning is elicited simply by prompting an off-the-shelf language\\nmodel. No language models were ﬁnetuned in the process of writing this paper.\\nThe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale has been a prevailing theme\\n(Wei et al., 2022b). For many reasoning tasks where standard prompting has a ﬂat scaling curve, chain-\\nof-thought prompting leads to dramatically increasing scaling curves. Chain-of-thought prompting\\nappears to expand the set of tasks that large language models can perform successfully—in other\\nwords, our work underscores that standard prompting only provides a lower bound on the capabilities\\nof large language models. This observation likely raises more questions than it answers—for instance,\\nhow much more can we expect reasoning ability to improve with a further increase in model scale?\\nWhat other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?\\nAs for limitations, we ﬁrst qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of\\nhuman reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually “reasoning,” which\\nwe leave as an open question. Second, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with\\nchains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for\\nﬁnetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot\\ngeneralization). Third, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct\\nand incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for\\nfuture work (Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022, inter alia ). Finally,\\nthe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model scales makes it costly to serve in\\nreal-world applications; further research could explore how to induce reasoning in smaller models.\\n7 Related Work\\nThis work is inspired by many research areas, which we detail in an extended related work section\\n(Appendix C). Here we describe two directions and associated papers that are perhaps most relevant.\\nThe ﬁrst relevant direction is using intermediate steps to solve reasoning problems. Ling et al. (2017)\\npioneer the idea of using natural language rationales to solve math word problems through a series\\nof intermediate steps. Their work is a remarkable contrast to the literature using formal languages\\nto reason (Roy et al., 2015; Chiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Cobbe\\net al. (2021) extend Ling et al. (2017) by creating a larger dataset and using it to ﬁnetune a pretrained\\nlanguage model rather than training a model from scratch. In the domain of program synthesis,\\nNye et al. (2021) leverage language models to predict the ﬁnal outputs of Python programs via\\nﬁrst line-to-line predicting the intermediate computational results, and show that their step-by-step\\nprediction method performs better than directly predicting the ﬁnal outputs.\\nNaturally, this paper also relates closely to the large body of recent work on prompting. Since the\\npopularization of few-shot prompting as given by Brown et al. (2020), several general approaches\\nhave improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al.,\\n2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang\\net al., 2022). Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g.,\\ninstructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the\\noutputs of language models with a chain of thought.\\n8 Conclusions\\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhanc-\\ning reasoning in language models. Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense\\nreasoning, we ﬁnd that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows\\nsufﬁciently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have ﬂat scaling curves.\\nBroadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire\\nfurther work on language-based approaches to reasoning.\\n9', doc_id='e4736d37-ea70-4d7f-bad5-95bfb920dbfc', embedding=None, doc_hash='5a433da1c6dd9442d80a1ee4698045745c82439180addbd7cbca9b5a21fed62b', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='Acknowledgements\\nWe thank Jacob Devlin, Claire Cui, Andrew Dai, and Ellie Pavlick for providing feedback on the\\npaper.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer beneﬁts such as improved\\nperformance and sample efﬁciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The “other category” included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters ﬁxed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were ﬁxed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often conﬂated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors ﬁxed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B ﬁxed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The ﬁrst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires sufﬁcient model scale. Finally, we\\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a ﬁnal answer that could be\\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a ﬁnal answer.\\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc). Future work could more thoroughly\\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\\n16', doc_id='9d36289a-7d1a-4684-ac49-346ecce42d7e', embedding=None, doc_hash='1725b9443ebfc0152f6d8cafee43e66b0a3f9a4f308c19e80ed061f104fa7acb', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text=\"Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden.

There is no shortage\\nof work showing that prompts affect language models in unexpected ways (Min et al., 2022). The\\ngeneral way that we created chain of thought annotations was by taking eight exemplars from the\\ntraining set and decomposing the reasoning process into multiple steps leading to the ﬁnal answer.\\nExamples of chain of thought annotations are provided in Figure 3, with full prompts given in\\nAppendix G. To analyze how sensitive chain of thought is to prompt engineering, we performed\\nrobustness experiments with respect to various factors.\\n•Different annotators. We ﬁrst analyze robustness to three different annotators (Section 3.4 and\\nFigure 6). Although there is notable variance in performance (which we will discuss later), chain\\nof thought performed better than the baseline by a large margin for all three annotators on eight\\ndatasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Table 6 and Table 7). Similar to the\\nannotation process in Cobbe et al. (2021), annotators were not given speciﬁc instructions about\\n17\", doc_id='42207447-9a6c-42b9-aa3c-4369578f11d2', embedding=None, doc_hash='f2dcdab9d77f0af134f1c74d6e02c3a824ed8164012a081940bde5e55766c18e', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='how to write the chain of thought annotations other than to simply write the step-by-step reasoning\\nprocess that led to the ﬁnal answer. Thus, the annotations were written in each annotator’s own\\nlinguistic “chain of thought” writing style.\\n•Annotators without machine learning background. The GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021)\\nconveniently provides a training set with reasoning chains written by crowd compute workers,\\nwhich enables us to investigate whether chain of thought still works with reasoning chains from an\\nindependent source without a background in machine learning. So we randomly sampled three sets\\nof eight exemplars with chains of thought from GSM8K. These chain of thought annotations also\\noutperformed the baseline by a large margin for all four arithmetic datasets (Table 6), indicating\\nthat chain of thought is not dependent on a particular set of annotators.\\n•Different exemplars. The different GSM8K exemplars experiment above (Table 6) also shows\\nthat chain-of-thought prompting works for different sets of exemplars. Notably, we test every set of\\nexemplars on all four arithmetic datasets (instead of picking exemplars from the training set for\\neach dataset), which suggests that the exemplars do not necessarily have to come from the same\\ndataset distribution as the test examples.\\n•Different order of exemplars. Prior work has shown that in some cases (e.g., classiﬁcation) even\\nthe order of prompts matter—varying the permutation of few-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy\\nof GPT-3 on SST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near SOTA (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).\\nWe show the standard deviation of performance from different exemplars in Table 6 and Table 7.\\nStandard deviations with respect to prompt order are relatively minimal in almost all cases. The\\none exception is the coin ﬂip task, for which exemplar orders have high standard deviation, likely\\nfor the reason cited in Zhao et al. (2021)—for classiﬁcation, many exemplars of the same category\\nin a row biases the model outputs).\\n•Different number of exemplars. We also found that gains from chain-of-thought prompting\\ngenerally still held when there was a varying number of few-shot exemplars. This is shown for ﬁve\\ndatasets in Figure 11 (we did not have the compute to run this for all datasets). We also found in\\npreliminary experiments that further increasing the number of exemplars in standard prompting\\ndid not lead to signiﬁcant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\\n•Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models. We ﬁnd that with the same\\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\\nTable 5). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\\nfor arithmetic reasoning, we want to be clear that prompt engineering still does matter, and can\\nimprove performance signiﬁcantly in many cases. Though most chain of thought annotations\\noutperform standard prompting, there is large variation in many cases. For instance, for the coin\\nﬂip task, the performance varied from 99.6% for Annotator A to 71.4% for Annotator C, though\\nboth were above standard prompting = 50.0% (see Table 7). There are even tasks where prompt\\nengineering is a requirement for good performance. In preliminary experiments, we tried using chain\\nof thought to enable language models to reverse the order of a list of 5 items. While two co-authors\\nwere not able to write chain of thought prompts that solved the task despite their best attempts, a third\\nco-author was able to write a chain of thought that perfectly solved the task.\\nHow to generate chain of thought annotations in a robust fashion could be an interesting direction\\nfor future work. For instance, an idea here could be to use a large language model to automatically\\ngenerate chains of thought via prompting (and potentially optimize this over a validation set).\\nA.3 Will chain-of-thought prompting improve performance for my task of interest?\\nWhile chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more\\nhelpful for some tasks than others. Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain\\nof thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires\\n18', doc_id='f3595dc2-ebc9-4a0a-b1ea-9743777ddee8', embedding=None, doc_hash='7d53a9f051c845097dba0324ba4d0854a9ccc26927c87397eff36932ce6a12f9', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='multi-step reasoning, (2) a large language model is used, and (3) the scaling curve is relatively ﬂat.\\nConversely, the beneﬁts are smaller when one or more of these conditions are not met.\\nThese intuitions are perhaps supported by the arithmetic reasoning results. The performance gain\\nfrom chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step\\nproblems, ﬂat scaling curve), which meets these conditions. The performance gain is small for the\\nsubsets of MAWPS that only require one or two steps (SingleOP, SingleEq, and AddSub), for which\\nPaLM 540B already achieves performance of 90% or higher (and it is also generally true that there is\\nless headroom for improvement when performance is already strong).\\nAlthough in this paper we focused on multi-step reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, and\\nsymbolic), chain-of-thought prompting can potentially be applied to any task for which humans use a\\n“chain of thought” to solve (at least in principle). We leave the empirical evaluation of chain-of-thought\\nprompting on such diverse tasks (e.g., machine translation, etc.) to future work.\\nA.4 Why is prompting with the equation only not enough for some arithmetic reasoning\\ndatasets?\\nPrompting with the equation only as an intermediate step does help on many datasets, especially when\\nthe datasets only require a few reasoning steps (SV AMP, ASDiv, MAWPS). For GSM8K, however,\\nusing the equation only did not improve performance substantially. Based on qualitative analysis, we\\nbelieve that these questions are too semantically challenging for the model to directly translate them\\ninto a math equation. Consider this example from LaMDA 137B:\\nQUESTION :Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the ﬁrst 20 minutes, he scores 4\\npoints. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. How many total points did he\\nscore?\\nEQUATION ONLY (WRONG ANSWER ):(4 + 20 * 0.25) = 6. The answer is 6.\\nCHAIN OF THOUGHT (CORRECT ):Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the ﬁrst\\n20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. So\\nhe scored 25% more in the second 20 minutes. 4 x 1.25 = 5. So he scored 5 points in the\\nsecond 20 minutes. So he scored 9 points in total. The answer is 9.\\nIt is hard for the model to directly translate all of the semantics into a single equation, but chain of\\nthought allows it to better reason about each part of the question via intermediate steps in natural\\nlanguage.\\n19', doc_id='82c6f137-6053-4b9c-9ed5-f651e6a56b07', embedding=None, doc_hash='09b3f1d9c7b9186cb0b2b1e6da1446bb5ddc6b35b62404ad173f3be1db5a4156', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='B All Experimental Results\\nThis section contains tables for experimental results for varying models and model sizes, on all\\nbenchmarks, for standard prompting vs. chain-of-thought prompting.\\nFor the arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, some chains of thought (along with the equations produced)\\nwere correct, except the model performed an arithmetic operation incorrectly.

(2020), and see Liu et al. (2021) for a\\nsurvey). This paper falls in the category of general prompting approaches, whereby input prompts are\\noptimized to allow a single large language model to better perform a variety of tasks (Li and Liang,\\n2021; Lester et al., 2021; Reif et al., 2022, inter alia ).\\nOne recent line of work aims to improve the ability of language models to perform a task by providing\\ninstructions that describe the task (Raffel et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). This line of work is related because it also augments input–output\\npairs with meta-data. But whereas an instruction augments the input to a task (instructions are typically\\nprepended to the inputs), chain-of-thought prompting augments the outputs of language models.\\nAnother related direction is sequentially combining the outputs of language models; human–computer\\ninteraction (HCI) work (Wu et al., 2022a,b) has shown that combining sequential generations of\\nlanguage models improves task outcomes in a 20-person user study.\\nC.2 Natural language explanations\\nAnother closely related direction uses natural language explanations (NLEs), often with the goal of\\nimproving model interpretability (Zhou et al., 2020; Wiegreffe and Marasovi ´c, 2021, inter alia ). That\\nline of work typically focuses on natural language inference (Camburu et al., 2018; Yordanov et al.,\\n2021; Bostrom et al., 2021), and produces explanations either simultaneously to or after the ﬁnal\\nprediction (Narang et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2021; Wiegreffe et al., 2021, 2022). By contrast,\\nthe chain of thought processing considered in this paper occurs before the ﬁnal answer. And while\\nNLE aims mostly to improve neural network interpretability (Rajagopal et al., 2021), the goal of\\nchain-of-thought prompting is to allow models to decompose multi-hop reasoning tasks into multiple\\nsteps—interpretability is just a side effect. Marasovi ´c et al. (2022) show that prompt-based ﬁnetuning\\nwith NLE improves NLI and classiﬁcation performance, though they largely focus on evaluating\\nexplanation plausibility. In comparison, our work focuses on a range of arithmetic, commonsense,\\nand symbolic tasks that require multi-hop reasoning.\\nC.3 Program synthesis and execution\\nUsing intermediate reasoning steps has a long history in program synthesis and execution (Zaremba\\nand Sutskever, 2014, inter alia ). Recent work along in this direction has included a number of\\narchitectural innovations (Cai et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020), as well as the use of\\nlarge language models (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). The program execution work closest to\\nours is perhaps Nye et al. (2021), which show that large language models can perform up to 10-digit\\naddition, evaluate polynomials, and execute python programs. Whereas generating a program and\\nthen executing it can be viewed as a type of reasoning, our work generalizes such domain-speciﬁc\\nprimitives to natural language, which is open-domain and relevant to any text-to-text NLP task in\\nprinciple.\\nC.4 Numeric and logical reasoning\\nNumeric and logical reasoning has been a long-studied task in machine learning and natural language\\nprocessing (Lev et al., 2004, inter alia ). Recent work has also aimed to inject numeric reasoning\\nabilities in language models in various ways, such as augmenting BERT with a predeﬁned set of\\nexecutable operations (Andor et al., 2019), including a graph neural network (Ran et al., 2019), and\\nusing specialized training procedures (Pi˛ ekos et al., 2021). Another line of work aims to enable\\nlanguage models to perform logical or formal reasoning, often by verablizing the rules in natural\\nlanguage formal rules using language (Clark et al., 2020; Saeed et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021).\\n24', doc_id='c743c9ad-4ca7-4426-ab40-64e51f4f69a8', embedding=None, doc_hash='18ccbe33c75c84aa7d47da63d52c204a84a045fcd87ac260a8ef3e5acbe1bc2b', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='Perhaps the most-related work here is Recchia (2021), which shows that ﬁnetuning enables longhand\\nmodule operations, which has previously been difﬁcult for performers. Whereas work in this direction\\nis often task-speciﬁc and uses ﬁnetuning, we show that chain-of-thought prompting works for a broad\\nrange of tasks without any ﬁnetuning.\\nC.5 Intermediate language steps\\nExtensive prior work has shown the beneﬁts of endowing neural networks with the ability to produce\\nintermediate steps via training or ﬁnetuning confers various beneﬁts in a range of scenarios. As\\nexamples, it has been shown that natural language intermediate steps can improve performance\\n(Zaidan et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2021; Hase and Bansal, 2022; Gu et al., 2022), improve robustness\\n(Chen et al., 2022), speed up training (Hancock et al., 2018), mitigate bias (Dua et al., 2020), and\\neven help in image and reinforcement learning settings (Andreas et al., 2018). To endow models with\\nthe ability to produce intermediate steps, prior work typically ﬁnetunes models on either manually\\nannotated training datasets (Camburu et al., 2018; Rajani et al., 2019, inter alia ) or generates synthetic\\ndatasets (Talmor et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022). Compared with these training or ﬁnetuning\\nmethods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-\\nshelf language models of sufﬁcient scale simply via prompting. This prompting setup is important\\nbecause it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and\\nbecause a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.\\nD Appendix: Additional Analysis\\nD.1 Correct Chain of Thought Analysis\\nAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from LaMDA 137B that led to\\ncorrect answers in the GSM8K dataset. Of these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through\\nincorrect reasoning (shown in Table 9: “correct by chance”). The other 49 had correct logic and\\nmath, with examples shown in Table 8. Five had minor imperfections while maintaining coherent and\\nunderstandable logic:\\n• One had underspeciﬁed statements (shown in Table 9: “correct but underspeciﬁed statements”).\\n•One made an unrelated but correct statement (shown in Table 9: “correct but unrelated statement”).\\n•Two had the correct logic but omitted speciﬁc steps in the equation, though it was still understand-\\nable (shown in Table 9: “correct but imperfect equation”).\\n•One had the correct math but inverted the semantics (shown in Table 9: “correct but inverted\\nsemantics”)\\nTable 8: Example of correct chains of thought produced by the model for the GSM8K dataset.\\nQUESTION :James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total\\nmeters does he run a week?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each\\nsprint. So he runs 60 meters x 3 sprints x 3 times a week. That is 60 meters x 9. The answer is 540. X\\nQUESTION :Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s\\niPhone. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon’s iPhone?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): Brandon’s iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Ben’s iPhone is 2\\ntimes older than Suzy’s iPhone. So Brandon’s iPhone is 4 x 2 = 8 times older than Suzy’s iPhone. Suzy’s iPhone\\nis 1 year old. So Brandon’s iPhone is 8 x 1 = 8 years old. The answer is 8. X\\nQUESTION :Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops. With the remaining lollipops, Jean wants to\\npackage 2 lollipops in one bag. How many bags can Jean ﬁll?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): Jean started with 30 lollipops. She ate 2 of them. So she has 28 lollipops\\nleft. She wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.\\nAnother one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. How many penguins are still left sunbathing?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BY CHANCE ):There are 36 penguins. One-third of them jump in and swim in\\nthe ocean. So that is 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. So that is 12 penguins.\\nThe answer is 12.\\nQUESTION :John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. There are an\\nadditional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. How many total windows are there between the\\nhouses?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNDERSPECIFIED STATEMENTS ):There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms\\neach. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. So there are 2 x 3 = 6 windows in each house. There are an additional\\n4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. So there are 4 + 4 = 8 windows in each house. So there are\\n6 x 2 = 12 windows in each house. So there are 12 + 8 = 20 windows in both houses. The answer is 20.\\nQUESTION :If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, how old will her brother be in 3 years?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNRELATED STATEMENT ):Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her\\nage. So her brother is 18 years old. In 3 years, she will be 12. So her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. The\\nanswer is 21.\\nQUESTION :A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon. An app company is offering $.20 cashback per\\ngallon if you ﬁll up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the\\ncashback rewards?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT IMPERFECT EQUATION ):The gas is originally 3 dollars per gallon. If\\nyou buy 10 gallons, that is 3 x 10 = 30 dollars. If you get 20 cents off per gallon, that is 20 x 10 = 2 dollars. So\\nthe total is 30 - 2 = 28 dollars. The answer is 28 dollars.\\nQUESTION :Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store’s Santa village. A third of\\nthe elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. How\\nmany elves are left?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT IMPERFECT EQUATION ):Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of\\nthem quit. So 60 - 1/3 = 40 elves are left. Then 10 elves quit. So 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left. The answer is 30\\nelves.\\nQUESTION :Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the ﬁreman’s luncheon.

At the end of the evening, after the\\nguests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. How many pieces were\\ntaken by the guests?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT INVERTED SEMANTICS ):5 pies were baked and cut into 8 pieces each.\\nThe 5 pies were then served to the guests. 8 x 5 = 40 pieces of pie. The guests ate 14 pieces of pie. 40 - 14 = 26\\npieces of pie were left. The answer is 26.

There are many ways that a chain of thought can be incorrect, making the design\\nof error categorization non-trivial. We decided to categorize errors into what changes are needed to\\nmake the chain of thought correct, with the goal of elucidating how the model can be improved in the\\nfuture.\\nWe found that many chains of thought can be made correct with one of the following three classes of\\nmodiﬁcation.\\n•Calculator error only. We found that 8% of the chains of thought were completely correct except\\nfor a calculator error—in other words, applying an external calculator to equations, as done in\\nCobbe et al. (2021), would make the chain of thought correct. An example of this type of error is\\nshown in Table 10: “calculator error only”. Indeed, the solve rate of chain-of-thought prompting\\non for LaMDA 137B GSM8K went up from 14.3% to 17.3% when we added a Python program\\nas an external calculator, as shown in Table 2. Also, 34% of the examples contained calculator\\nerrors in addition to other types of errors. However, we perform the rest of the error categorization\\nindependently of calculator errors.\\n•Symbol mapping error. We next found that 16% percent of the chains of thought were correct\\nexcept for what we call symbol mapping errors. We deﬁne a symbol mapping error as when the\\nchain of thought is correct except for the number symbols, and it could be made totally correct by\\nmodifying only the equations and not the words. As one might argue that they could simply place\\nthe correct ﬁnal equation in any chain of thought, we constrain this category to chains of thought\\nwhere the chain of thought can be modiﬁed to be a completely correct reasoning process (not just\\nﬁnal answer). An example of this error category is shown in Table 10: “symbol mapping error”.\\n•One step missing error. Our next category of error is chains of thought which were correct except\\nthat they were missing a single step. In other words, these chains of thoughts could be rewritten to\\nbe correct by adding in an additional reasoning step that was missed by the model. An example of\\nthis error category is shown in Table 10: “one step missing error”. We found that 22% percent of\\nthe errors fell into this category.\\nTable 10: Example of incorrect chains of thought, categorized as described in Appendix D.2.\\nQUESTION :Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns\\nare there total?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;CALCULATOR ERROR ONLY ):Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush\\nhas 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. So 3 x 25 x 8 = 300. The answer is 300. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The produced chain of thought could be made correct just by\\nrunning the equation through an external calculator, instead of asking the model to do the computation.\\nQUESTION :Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a\\nyear, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what’s her annual salary?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;SYMBOL MAPPING ERROR ):Jill gets paid 20 dollars per hour to teach\\nand 30 dollars per hour to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher\\nand 15 hours a week as a coach, then she works 50 x 35 = 1750 hours as a teacher and 15 x 30 = 450 hours as a\\ncoach. So she works 1750 + 450 = 2200 hours. She gets paid 20 dollars per hour for 1750 hours and 30 dollars\\nper hour for 450 hours. So her annual salary is 20 x 1750 + 30 x 450 = $36,500. The answer is $36,500. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The model incorrectly mapped “15 x 30” instead of “15 x 50”, and\\nthe chain of thought would be made correct by ﬁxing just that one change (with an external calculator).\\nQUESTION :Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having\\ntwice as many instructions as the ﬁrst one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two\\ndishes?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;ONE STEP MISSING ERROR ):Kelian has two recipes. One has 20 instruc-\\ntions. The other has twice as many instructions as the ﬁrst one. So the second one has 40 instructions. So Kelian\\nhas to read 40 instructions to prepare the two dishes. The answer is 40. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The model answer could be made correct just adding one additional\\nstep (in this case, adding 20 and 40).\\n27', doc_id='ce268897-3d4e-47a5-96a7-26ba4520498c', embedding=None, doc_hash='628a3cd1c4db8c547918e2c14feffc30284bb21ec29bb2ec6a1b2934e4d5db34', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='We found that the remaining chains of thought (27 of 50; 54%) would require substantial edits to make\\ninto a correct chain of thought.

How many gold coins\\ndoes Gretchen have?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING ERROR ):Gretchen has 110 coins. There\\nare 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So there are 110 - 30 = 80 silver coins. So there are 80 silver coins and\\n110 - 80 = 30 gold coins.

The rest enrolled in hip-hop\\ndance. So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the percentage of the students\\nenrolled in hip-hop dance, minus the percentage of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, minus the\\npercentage of the students enrolled in jazz dance. So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop\\ndance is (25 + 20) - (25 + 20) = 100%. The answer is 100%. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :This chain of thought is incoherent in that the percent of entire\\nstudents enrolled in hip-hope dance cannot be the percent of student enrolled in hip-hop dance minus another\\nterm.\\nOverall, there are no guarantees that the reasoning processes generated by large language models\\nare coherent or factually correct, as underscored by the recent work evaluating the factuality of\\nlanguage model generations and explanations (Maynez et al., 2020; Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and\\nDurrett, 2022; Marasovi ´c et al., 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022). Incorrect reasoning processes can lead\\nto both incorrect ﬁnal answers as well as accidentally correct ﬁnal answers (with accidentally correct\\nﬁnal answers being more likely for tasks such as binary classiﬁcation as opposed to free response).\\nImproving the factuality of language model generations with respect to context and world knowledge\\nis an important direction open problems in language model research and could also be expected to\\npotentially improve multi-step reasoning abilities of language models. One potential method for\\nimproving the quality of decoding could involve generating multiple reasoning paths and scoring\\neach of them with a veriﬁer, though this requires training the veriﬁer (Cobbe et al., 2021; Shen et al.,\\n2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022).\\nD.3 Additional Robustness Analysis\\nAs the experiments in the main paper use a ﬁxed number of few-shot exemplars (8; as constrained by\\nthe input length of 1024 tokens), we verify that the chain-of-thought prompting is robust to various\\nnumbers of few-shot exemplars. We run experiments for LaMDA 137B, comparing chain-of-thought\\nprompting with standard prompting for the ﬁve datasets where standard prompting had a mostly ﬂat\\nscaling curve (the largest model did not achieve high performance).

Introduction\\nSentence representation learning is a fundamental problem in natural lan-\\nguage processing (NLP). It learns to encode sentences into compact, dense\\nvectors, called embeddings, which can be broadly useful for a wide range of\\ntasks, such as Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) [1], language understanding\\nand evaluation [2, 3] and information retrieval [4, 5].\\nRecent work has shown that finetuning pre-trained language models with\\ncontrastive learning is the most effective and efficient for sentence represen-\\ntation learning. The instance of contrastive learning makes embeddings of\\nsemantically similar pairs close to each other while pushing dissimilar ones\\napart [6]. In contrastive learning, previous methods [7, 8, 9] use multiple ways\\nto construct sentence pairs for supervised or unsupervised training. Specifi-\\ncally, supervised contrastive methods [7, 10] usually create sentence pairs us-\\ning several publicly available Natural language inference (NLI) datasets, like\\nStanford NLI (SNLI) dataset [11] and MultiGenre NLI (MNLI) dataset [12].\\nMeanwhile, unsupervised contrastive methods [7, 13, 14] leverage unlabeled\\nsentences from Wikipedia or any other public resources. In general, super-\\nvised contrastive learning methods outperform unsupervised ones although\\nthe former need multi-source large-scale labeled training data. Usually, previ-\\nous research follows the standard evaluation protocol that uses the SentEval\\ntoolkit [15] on the standard semantic textual similarity (STS) benchmark for\\nevaluation purposes. Accordingly, several benchmark datasets for STS and\\nNLI have been released by targeting at English.\\nWhen it comes to Japanese, things are different. Although JSNLI [22]\\nand JSICK [23] datasets are publicly available, STS12-16 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],\\nSTS-B [21] and 7 transfer tasks from SentEval [15], and MNLI datasets [12]\\nin Japanese do not exist. Here, JSNLI dataset is translated from the SNLI\\ndataset using machine translation, and JSICK dataset is made manually\\nbased on the SICK [24] dataset. We believe that the lack of publicly avail-\\nable benchmark datasets for Japanese STS has led to the lack of interest in\\nbuilding Japanese sentence representation models and devising applications\\nbased on them. Motivated by this, we believe it is time to construct and\\nrelease a comprehensive Japanese STS benchmark. In addition, we publish\\n2', doc_id='1ca27349-da8d-4ad5-9045-d1320f0aad4c', embedding=None, doc_hash='dee3b3f4a4691df41ca213dfa61e371ad6a93e5dc797d88d5a6a434abf856180', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='various Japanese sentence embedding models trained mainly by contrastive\\nlearning and propose a novel effectively method as our core work of this paper\\nfor the domain-specific downstream tasks.\\nIn this context, we propose an efficient Japanese sentence representation\\nlearning framework that leverages data generation to perform contrastive\\nlearning on domain-specific downstream tasks. This framework is named\\nJCSE that is derived from “Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings\\nfor Japanese”. JCSE is built upon pre-trained transformer language mod-\\nels [25, 26]. We first collect a domain-specific raw corpus in a target domain.\\nAfterward, we finetune a pre-trained data generator (in our case T5 [26]) on\\nour collected domain-specific corpus using unsupervised fill-in-the-blank-style\\ndenoising training. It is then used to construct negative (contradictory) pairs\\nfor input sentences. In previous research [23], Japanese language models pre-\\ndict entailment labels without considering word order or case particles. The\\nexperimental settings for whether the existence of case particles can change\\nentailment labels [23] inspire us to investigate which word types in Japanese\\nare the most relevant for different Japanese language models. The results of\\nour relevant content words experiments [27] show that nouns are the most\\nrelevant content words in a Japanese sentence. It means that negative pairs\\nfor input sentences can be constructed by substituting nouns in them using\\nthe finetuned data generator. Referring to SimCSE [7], we construct pos-\\nitive pairs by simply using different dropout masks. In this way, sentence\\npairs are synthesized for contrastive learning. Finally, we apply a two-stage\\ncontrastive learning recipe that finetune a Japanese language model first on\\nsynthesized sentence pairs and then on JSNLI.\\nTo evaluate our method JCSE compared with various existing embedding\\nmethods, we choose multiple proper Japanese sentence embedding models\\nbased on the results of our established Japanese STS benchmark. On the STS\\nbenchmark, Japanese sentence embedding models yield similar results to the\\ncase of English, that is, applying contrastive learning to sentence embedding\\nmodels leads to performance improvements. Concern about our Japanese\\nSTS benchmark, as described above, STS12-16 and STS-B in Japanese still\\ndo not exist. Referring to previous research [22, 28], machine translation\\nis used to translate English STS12-16 and STS-B datasets into Japanese.\\nCombining the translated datasets with existing JSICK [23] and Japanese\\nSTS (JSTS) datasets included in the JGLUE [53], we construct and release\\n3', doc_id='d9e3c1bb-a9c4-46e4-841b-f4d903554204', embedding=None, doc_hash='a23b0e5fa3f1e297a3946c0f0fdce3d5348de38e1f73f585e2aa38385eed0ffc', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='this comprehensive version of the Japanese STS benchmark1.\\nIn parallel, with the direct transfer of Japanese sentence embedding mod-\\nels to the two domain-specific downstream tasks, contrastive learning leads\\nto better performance than previous embedding methods, but those improve-\\nments are diminutive.

Surprisingly, we find that directly integrating our collected domain-\\nspecific corpus into the Japanese sentence embedding models using previous\\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive learning methods can also signifi-\\ncantly improve the performance of the domain-specific downstream tasks.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\\n•We propose JCSE that is a novel effective and efficient Japanese sen-\\ntence representation learning framework for domain adaptation on Japanese\\ndomain-specific downstream tasks.\\n•We construct and release a comprehensive Japanese STS benchmark.\\nTo our best knowledge, we are the first to evaluate multiple Japanese\\nsentence embedding models on this comprehensive benchmark.\\n•We propose a new human-annotated QAbot dataset for an information\\nretrieval task in a Japanese educational domain.\\n2. Background and Related Work\\n2.1. Contrastive Learning\\nContrastive learning aims to learn effective representation by pulling se-\\nmantically close neighbors together and pushing apart non-neighbors [30].\\nA training set of contrastive learning is defined by paired examples each of\\n1https://github.com/mu-kindai/JCSE\\n4', doc_id='2e00a341-bc7c-4ac3-abc2-b36e681bad62', embedding=None, doc_hash='f31ec015cfd9c3747d7b4a758dc7af8c0bb9dc4b3995f406d3a819507a8f620b', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='which is denoted by D={(vi, v+\\ni)}. Here, viis the embedding of the ith\\nsentence and v+\\niis the one of a sentence semantically related to the ith sen-\\ntence. During training, v+\\niis considered a positive example for viand all\\nother examples in a batch are considered negatives [31, 32]. For a mini-batch\\nofNpairs, the contrastive loss function is defined as:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ, (1)\\nwhere τis a temperature hyperparameter, sim( v1, v2) is the cosine similarity\\nv1⊤v2\\n∥v1∥·∥v2∥. When additional negatives v−\\njare provided for vi, the contrastive\\nloss can be enhanced as:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1(esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ+esim(vi,v−\\nj)/τ). (2)\\nSimCSE [7] applies different hard negatives from other in-batch negatives,\\nextends Eq. 2 to incorporate weighting of different negatives:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1(esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ+α1j\\niesim(vi,v−\\nj)/τ), (3)\\nwhere 1j\\ni∈ {0,1}is an indicator that equals 1 if and only if i=j, and αis\\na weighting hyperparameter.\\nOne crucial question in contrastive learning is how to construct ( vi, v+\\ni)\\npairs. Some research [8, 9, 33] apply multiple augmentation techniques such\\nas word deletion, reordering, cutoff, and substitution. Kim et al. [34] directly\\nuse the hidden representation of BERT as well as its final sentence embed-\\ndings. SimCSE [7] simply feeds the same input to the encoder twice and\\nconstructs positive pairs using different dropout masks. This simple method\\nhas proved to be more effective than other strategies. Previous methods\\nmainly focus on constructing positive pairs while negative pairs are gener-\\nated through random sampling. Several works [35, 36] in the computer vision\\ncommunity show that hard negative examples are essential for contrastive\\nlearning. Robinson et al. [37] use an importance sampling method to select\\nhard negative examples. For NLP, Kalantidis et al. [38] improve MoCo [39]\\nby generating hard negative examples through mixing positive and nega-\\ntive examples in the memory bank which keeps a queue with features of the\\n5', doc_id='405b1326-06ab-41f8-8597-e262b7ff64b1', embedding=None, doc_hash='9fe7b602e0f4a28700fe8a2ed6ae1fd6f26d17638c178509ae3c76a08d39f9e3', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='last few batches. MixCSE [13] constructs artificial hard negative features\\nvia mixing both positive and negative samples for unsupervised sentence\\nrepresentation learning. While supervised sentence representation learning\\nrelies on large-scale human-annotated sentence pairs, we often face with the\\nscarcity of human-annotated datasets, especially low-resource languages like\\nJapanese.\\n2.2. Domain Adaption for downstream task\\nDomain Adaptation is a fundamental challenge in NLP. The most com-\\nmon domain adaption technique for a pre-trained language model is domain-\\nadaptive pre-training which continues pre-taining on in-domain data. Recent\\nwork [40] has shown empirically that domain adaptation improves a language\\nmodel’s performance on a target domain. Specifically, the researchers in\\n[40] experiment with eight classification tasks ranging across four domains\\n(biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews). The\\nresults show that continued pre-training of an already powerful language\\nmodel on the domain consistently improves performance on tasks in a target\\ndomain. BioBERT [41] shows that pre-training BERT on biomedical cor-\\npora largely improves its performance on downstream tasks of biomedical\\ntext mining. Meanwhile, Guo et al. [42] and Ma et al. [43] show that neu-\\nral retrieval models trained on a general domain often do not transfer well,\\nespecially for specialized domains.\\nThere is no labeled training data in many target domains. To over-\\ncome this, leveraging generative models to produce synthetic data has been\\npreviously explored. Du et al. [44] first apply a seq2seq model for auto-\\nmatic question generation from text passages in a reading comprehension\\ntask. Puri et al. [45] first demonstrate that a QA model trained on purely\\nsynthetic questions and answers can outperform models trained on human-\\nlabeled data on SQuAD1.1. Ma et al. [43] and Liang et al. [46] use synthetic\\nqueries for domain adaptive neural retrieval. Yue et al. [47] leverage question\\ngeneration to synthesize QA pairs on clinical contexts and boost QA models\\nwithout requiring manual annotations. Another research [48] trains a QA\\nsystem on both source data and generated data from a target domain with\\na contrastive adaptation loss. However, to our best knowledge, there is no\\nrecent research that addresses domain adaptation in a domain-specific task\\ninvolving Japanese sentences.\\n6', doc_id='6cd8a20e-9e89-4e36-8568-cfebcd3091a6', embedding=None, doc_hash='e0a97884e3a5527f0c4c28dd2529cead97ebe5e22449f14c0f73b617bf37018f', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='2.3. Non-English data construction\\nWith the development of multilingual pre-trained language models, gen-\\neral language understanding frameworks for languages other than English\\nhave been created, and NLI datasets have been multilingualized. Conneau\\net al. [49] provided a cross-lingual NLI (XNLI) dataset by translating MNLI\\n[12] into 15 languages, including languages with few language resources such\\nas Urdu and Swahili. However, Japanese is not included in it.\\nAs examples of non-English datasets, OCNLI [50] is a Chinese NLI dataset\\nbuilt from original Chinese multi-genre resources. Ham et al. [28] create\\nKorNLI and KorSTS datasets by translating English NLI and STS-B [21]\\ndatasets into Korean. There are also attempts to translate the SICK dataset\\n[24] into Dutch [51] and Portuguese [52].\\nRegarding Japanese, a Japanese SNLI (JSNLI) dataset [22] is constructed\\nby employing machine translation to translate the English SNLI dataset into\\nJapanese and automatically filtering out unnatural sentences. JSICK [23]\\ndataset is manually translated from the English SICK dataset [24]. Ya-\\nhoo Japan constructs a Japanese GLUE benchmark [53] from scratch with-\\nout translation due to the cultural/social discrepancy between English and\\nJapanese. Although employing machine translation incurs several possibil-\\nities to produce unnatural sentences, it is more cost-efficient than manual\\ntranslation and reconstruction from scratch.\\n3. Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings for Japanese\\nFig. 1 illustrates an overview of JCSE. For a target domain, we collect a\\nraw corpus from public resources and use GINZA2, an open-source Japanese\\nNLP library, to divide the corpus into sentences.

Finally,\\nwe train a sentence embedding model using contrastive learning based on\\nsynthesized pairs and human-annotated sentence pairs, here is the JSNLI\\ndataset.

We formulate data generation as a fill-in-the-blank task where the T5\\nmodel predicts missing words within a corrupted piece of text in a text-to-\\ntext format.\\nAs described in Section 1, we find that nouns are the most relevant con-\\ntent words in Japanese sentences. Hence, for the target domain unlabeled\\nsentences, we first perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging for every sentence\\nusing GINZA and spaCy [54]. The POS-tags labels are determined using\\nspaCy [54]. Then we mask all noun tokens, more precisely mask noun chunks\\nrather than noun tokens to generate more natural data. Each corrupted noun\\nchunk is replaced by a sentinel token that is unique over the example. The\\nsentinel token is assigned a token ID that is unique to the sentence. The\\nsentinel IDs are special tokens that are added to the T5 model’s vocabulary\\nand do not correspond to any word piece [26]. We formulate our data gen-\\neration as a fill-in-the-blank task where the input is a sentence corrupted\\nwith multiple sentinel tokens and the target output is the relevant text in\\n5https://slack.com/\\n6https://github.com/mu-kindai/JCSE\\n9', doc_id='9acf4e98-603d-40a2-9947-21d19a1ac126', embedding=None, doc_hash='4068c883cdc891faa1a24fa4fa79964f9c6d145848099b642149b8e22d92eed7', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='the missing location. It is illustrated in Figure 1 (b) where <X>,<Y>and\\n<Z>in the box annotated with “Mask Noun chunks” are filled with terms\\nin the box with “Fill-in-the-black”.\\nA pre-trained T5 model already has the ability to carry out the fill-in-the-\\nblank task without finetuning. However, it is pre-trained on general domain\\ncorpora without considering sufficient knowledge of specific domains such as\\nclinical and computer science domains. Also, the word distribution of general\\nand specific domain corpora are quite different, so there is no ability for the\\npre-trained T5 model to generate proper domain-specific terms. Hence, it\\nis essential to finetune the pre-trained T5 model on unlabeled data in the\\ntarget domain using unsupervised denoising training. Referring to T5 official\\ntraining settings [26], we randomly mask 15 percent of tokens and keep the\\naverage length of spans as 3. It is illustrated in Figure 1 (a). The fine-tuned\\nT5 model is used as our data generator.\\n3.3. Contrastive learning based on hard negatives\\nInspired by SimCSE [7], contrastive learning based on hard negatives is\\nperformed as illustrated in Figure 1 (c).

We also apply in-\\nbatch negative sampling where all other examples in a batch are considered as\\nnegatives.

Experiments\\nIn this section, we describe the experiments for this paper. To evaluate\\nthe performance of existing sentence representation methods and choose the\\nones compared to JCSE, first we establish a Japanese STS benchmark and\\nevaluate various Japanese sentence embedding models on it. Then we do\\nthe relevant content words experiments and find that nouns are the most\\nrelevant content words for Japanese language models. Afterward, we generate\\ncontradictory sentences using finetuned data generator and conduct domain\\nadaptation for down-stream tasks using contrastive learning with a two-stage\\ntraining recipe. Last, we evaluate JCSE compared with direct transfer and\\nother training strategies on two domain-specific downstream tasks. More\\nexperiment details are described following.\\n4.1. Japanese STS benchmark Construction\\nWe release a Japanese STS benchmark in our work. We combine the\\npublished JSICK [23] and JSTS [53] datasets with translated STS12-16 and\\nSTS-B datasets using machine translation. The translated datasets are de-\\nrived from original English datasets. We apply a similar translation strategy\\nby referring to the previous methods [22, 28].\\nFirst, we translate all of the STS12-16 and STS-B datasets into Japanese\\nusing Google translate API7and DeepL translate API8. Then, the translated\\nsentences are automatically filtered based on their BLEU scores [55]. More\\nspecifically, we translate each of the translated Japanese datasets back into\\nEnglish using the same machine translator, then we compute the BLEU1\\nscore between the original and translated English sentences. We find that\\nmost of the BLEU scores are 0 when using N > 1 ofN-gram, so we just apply\\nthe BLEU1 score. Unlike the previous research [22, 28], we do not translate\\nsentences in the development and test sets using human translation or post-\\nedit translation results by professional translators due to cost efficiency.\\nLast, to ensure the quality and decide on the translation data translated\\nfrom Google or DeepL translator, we conduct an experiment by referring to\\nthe previous method [22] that trains a linear regression model on different\\ntranslated data defined by diverse BLEU1 score thresholds. Detailedly, a\\nlinear model is built by adding a linear layer on the top layer’s CLS token of\\n7https://cloud.google.com/translate/\\n8https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api\\n11', doc_id='e36c6f4c-b3ac-4ddf-ad79-aae90f3200d7', embedding=None, doc_hash='3444d8132a3b96814409c146bc712107be0929778271b920ea10c30086018e3f', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='Google translator\\nBLEU threshold - 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3\\ndatasize 21172 20612 20449 19508 18207 16694 14904\\nMAE 0.4415 0.4443 0.4807 0.4493 0.4963 0.4966 0.4916\\nMSE 0.3384 0.336 0.3793 0.3332 0.412 0.4191 0.4018\\nR2 0.6481 0.6505 0.6058 0.6537 0.5727 0.5632 0.5822\\nDeepL translator\\nBLEU threshold - 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3\\ndatasize 21172 19337 19144 18368 17535 16683 15727\\nMAE 0.4206 0.433 0.4314 0.4397 0.451 0.4448 0.442\\nMSE 0.3058 0.3135 0.3117 0.324 0.342 0.3312 0.328\\nR2 0.6894 0.6802 0.6834 0.6711 0.6529 0.6638 0.6666\\nLast edition\\ndatasize 19330 MAE 0.4119 MSE 0.2821 R2 0.7137\\nTable 1: The performance of different models trained on different translated data.

We consider\\nboth unsupervised and supervised sentence representation models to apply a\\ncomprehensive evaluation. Unsupervised baselines include average FastText\\nembeddings [56], average BERT embeddings [25], and post-processing meth-\\nods such as BERT-flow [57] and BERT-whitening [58]. We also compare\\nseveral recent state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods including Sim-\\nCSE [7], MixCSE [13], and DiffCSE [14]. Other supervised methods include\\nSBERT [59], CoSENT9and SimCSE [7].\\nWe apply official codes to train a Japanese sentence embedding model\\nbased on each of the above-mentioned sentence representation methods. We\\ntried various hyperparameters in the training process, and find that the of-\\nficially recommended hyperparameters are better than others in most situa-\\ntions. Thus, in this section, all the Japanese sentence embedding models are\\ntrained in the hyperparameters referred to as relative officially recommended\\ntraining settings. The models trained based on BERT-base or BERT-large\\nusing their public checkpoints10.\\nFor unsupervised contrastive learning methods, we apply the Wikipedia\\n9https://github.com/bojone/CoSENT\\n10https://huggingface.co/cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese & https://huggingface.co/cl-\\ntohoku/bert-large-japanese\\n13', doc_id='b3635429-0d42-4bdc-9222-b202c171c07b', embedding=None, doc_hash='979a82d08663d047ef757e6deee38ffa4839fb28683dd288c2949c56269b1ae6', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='data as training data. We use WikiExtractor11and GiNZA to make unlabeled\\nsentences from the latest Japanese Wikipedia corpus, and randomly sample\\n106sentences as training data. For supervised methods, all the models are\\ntrained just on the JSNLI dataset due to data availability.\\nTable 3 shows the evaluation results. The performances of Japanese sen-\\ntence embedding models on the Japanese STS tasks is a little different from\\nthose on the English STS benchmark tasks. For the unsupervised methods,\\nrecent state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods perform better than pre-\\nvious baselines, and the MixCSE method shows the best or nearly best re-\\nsults on almost all STS tasks. Surprisingly, we find that models trained on\\nRoBERTa [60] pre-trained checkpoints12using a contrastive learning method\\nsuch as SimCSE (i.e., SimCSE-RoBERTa-base model) get poor results even\\nworse than previous baselines on some STS tasks, so we do not choose mod-\\nels trained on RoBERTa checkpoints to compare with JCSE. For supervised\\nmethods, the models using the contrastive learning method should achieve\\nbetter performance than the previous state-of-the-art SBERT [59] model, re-\\nversely, SBERT beyond SimCSE in our experiments because of much smaller\\ntraining data compared to those in the English experiments. Specifically, we\\nuse the JSNLI dataset which is about half of the training data in the English\\nexperiments [7], which uses the SNLI [11] and MNLI [12] datasets. This\\npoint easily overlooked in others research, but uncovered in our experiment.\\nThis is also the reason that unsupervised contrastive learning methods get\\nbetter performance than supervised contrastive learning methods in our ex-\\nperiments. After checking Table 3, we can find that the results on the human-\\nannotated STS datasets and the machine-translated datasets indicate differ-\\nent trends. This reflects the obvious gap between machine translation and\\nhuman annotation. To emphasize the performance on the human-annotated\\nSTS tasks, we also show the results just on JSICK and JSTS datasets in\\nTable 4. The results show that supervised contrastive learning methods\\nget nearly competitive performance compared with unsupervised contrastive\\nlearning methods even the labeled training data is limited. Contrastive learn-\\ning methods surpass previous methods which is similar with the results in\\nTable 3.\\n11https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor\\n12https://huggingface.co/nlp-waseda/roberta-base-japanese &\\nhttps://huggingface.co/nlp-waseda/roberta-large-japanese\\n14', doc_id='45cac3c7-ec6c-467f-a4f5-d79a2791485e', embedding=None, doc_hash='45f7ee1581cb7eb14ec62b138fe6e2fd66b4d76e248184912135824ab2b0c280', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='Model STS12 STS13 STS14 STS15 STS16 STS-B JSICK JSTS Avg.\\nUnsupervised models\\nFastText embeddings (avg.) 42.78 51.71 42.45 54.24 54.06 51.30 74.76 60.23 53.94\\nBERT-base (first-last avg.) 38.66 52.06 36.41 55.69 57.06 51.39 71.97 65.19 53.55\\nBERT-base-flow 44.25 55.60 42.62 65.77 60.67 55.10 77.26 64.90 58.27\\nBERT-base-whitening 39.14 55.19 41.76 57.27 57.93 46.26 71.86 56.00 53.18\\nSimCSE-BERT-base 56.82 66.45 55.66 74.80 72.73 69.71 77.20 71.66 68.13\\nSimCSE-BERT-large 55.26 62.66 51.95 72.76 69.49 65.20 77.63 72.98 65.99\\nSimCSE-RoBERTa-base 48.65 60.09 46.97 66.10 65.29 59.88 72.32 63.82 60.39\\nMixCSE-BERT-base 55.07 67.45 56.94 74.35 73.11 70.21 76.97 71.85 68.24\\nMixCSE-BERT-large 56.56 64.59 54.84 74.55 70.85 67.76 78.15 73.89 67.65\\nDiffCSE-BERT-base 57.59 67.07 55.93 74.07 72.88 69.37 76.29 71.07 68.03\\nSupervised models\\nSBERT-base 58.79 60.51 53.30 68.64 66.59 64.76 65.25 75.28 64.14\\nSBERT-large 60.57 64.27 54.24 70.92 65.91 66.17 67.68 76.84 65.83\\nCoSENT 61.73 58.28 52.46 64.72 63.02 63.27 56.81 74.17 61.81\\nSimCSE-BERT-base 51.65 54.43 46.49 63.92 60.81 57.33 74.19 69.12 59.74\\nSimCSE-BERT-large 50.29 56.47 48.10 67.76 59.64 59.63 77.48 69.73 60.80\\nTable 3: Sentence embedding performance on STS tasks (Spearman’s correlation, “all”\\nsetting).

Relevant Content Words\\nThe core insight of JCSE is to generate target domain contradiction sen-\\ntence pairs for contrastive learning. As we described above, we find that\\nnouns are the most relevant content words and construct negative pairs for\\nthe anchor sentences by substituting noun phrases in them. Empirically, not\\nall word types play an equal role in determining the semantics of a Japanese\\nsentence. A previous study [23] insufficiently verifies this opinion but gives\\nus inspiration.\\nIn this section, we investigate which part-of-speech (POS) tags mainly\\ninfluence on examining if a Japanese sentence pair is semantically similar or\\nnot for different Japanese sentence embedding models. To measure this, we\\nborrow the approach used in TSDAE [27]. We select a sentence pair ( a, b)\\nthat is labeled as relevant and find the word that maximally reduces the\\ncosine-similarity score for the pair ( a, b):\\nˆw= argmaxw(cossim( a, b)−min(cossim( a\\\\w, b),cossim( a, b\\\\w))) (6)\\namong all words wthat appear in either a or b. We record the POS tags for\\nˆwand compute the distribution of POS tags among all sentence pairs. The\\nPOS tags are defined using spaCy [54].\\nThe results on the three datasets are shown in Figure 2. We find that\\nnouns (NOUN) are by far the most relevant content words in a Japanese sen-\\ntence across the three datasets, and we do not perceive significant differences\\nbetween all three datasets. This result is important for our method because\\nit experimentally validates the theoretical foundation of our method. That is,\\nit is practical to substitute nouns to construct contradiction sentence pairs.\\n4.4. Experiment Setting\\nIn this section, we describe two experiment settings in our method, in-\\ncluding data generation, and domain adaptation.\\nData generation : We bridge a gap between the scarcity of domain-\\nspecific data in low-resource language and the demand of sufficient training\\ndata for contrastive learning using data generation. In our work, we first fine-\\ntune the pre-trained T5-base checkpoint on the target domain corpus to get\\nour target domain data generator. Then we mask all noun chunks in every\\nsentence with unique sentinel tokens as an input of the data generator. Af-\\nterward, we apply a simple unsampled beam search decode algorithm [61, 62]\\n16', doc_id='25578a29-d509-431b-a1b8-8d43dc85bf8a', embedding=None, doc_hash='2db367c648b60e3280985225364bf7edfbda051e287b5c174564e5aafd8640e1', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='Figure 2: POS tags for the most relevant content words in sentences.

We use Adafactor [64] as the optimizer and set\\nthe learning rate to 0.001 implemented using Pytorch and Huggingface and\\ntrained on three NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti.\\nDomain adaption : JCSE focuses on domain adaption characterized by\\nthe following two-stage contrastive learning recipe. A pre-trained sentence\\nembedding model is firstly adapted to a target domain by fine-tuning it on\\nthe synthesized generated sentence pairs. Then, the model is further fine-\\ntuned on labeled JSNLI data. We find that this training sequence, first on\\nthe synthesized generated data and then on JSNLI data, is better for our\\nmethod where reverse training sequence can harm the performance.\\nIn our experiment, both two training stages utilize the improved con-\\ntrastive learning method that incorporates different weighting with different\\nhard negatives. The training objective is described in section 3.3. In stage\\none, to formulate the triple training data {v, v+, v−}, we apply a generated\\ncontradictory sentence as v−based on vto get a negative pair.

For the\\nQAbot dataset, it is a question retrieval task. Hence, we apply a simple\\nfirst-stage dense retrieval system with two-tower architecture by referring to\\nprevious studies [43, 46, 65]. More specifically, we extract the mean em-\\nbedding on top of layers to obtain the final query/question representation\\nfrom two-tower retrieval models consisting of two independent Japanese sen-\\ntence embedding models: one for each of the query and question towers, re-\\nspectively. We use Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rank\\n(MRR), and Precision at N (P@N) as the evaluation metrics.\\nDuring the evaluation process, we first consider the direct transfer sce-\\nnario where generated target domain data are not used for sentence em-\\nbedding training. Then we evaluate the model for domain adaption, where\\nsynthesized generated target domain data are used in stage one, and the\\ngeneral domain JSNLI data are used in stage two. We also combine the un-\\nlabeled target domain corpus with the Wikipedia corpus for the unsupervised\\ncontrastive learning method in the training process. The results for the two\\ntasks are shown in Table 6.\\nTable 6 shows that our method improves the performance through do-\\n20', doc_id='d246cfc5-eef9-49e9-b9b1-8eb219bec95b', embedding=None, doc_hash='1811b9ab2d74bfa4131918db6d4215d206892b1ba986aa3546cb8255e74d5521', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='main adaptation using synthesized generated in-domain data. Even just\\nusing the generated data after the first stage of contrastive learning training\\ncan achieve competitive results compared with the out-of-the-box sentence\\nembedding models for direct transfer which means that the first stage train-\\ning uses much less training data than the data used in direct transfer but\\ngets improved performance. And further training using the JSNLI dataset\\ncan further improve our method’s performance after the second stage of con-\\ntrastive learning training. Superingsly, we also find that combining the in-\\ndomain corpus with the Wikipedia corpus in the training process can benefit\\nexisting unsupervised contrastive learning methods. The significant and con-\\nsistent improvements over the two tasks also demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nour data generation approach by fine-tuning a T5 model. Furthermore, com-\\npared to direct transfer and just directly integrating the in-domain corpus\\ninto existing contrastive learning methods, our approach achieves the best\\nperformance on almost all metrics with less training data scale, which con-\\nvincingly demonstrate that JCSE is an efficient and effective Japanese sen-\\ntence representation framework for better sentence embedding on Japanese\\ndomain-specific downstream tasks.\\n5. Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel effective Japanese sentence representa-\\ntion learning framework, JCSE, for the Japanese domain-specific downstream\\ntasks. Meanwhile, we establish Japanese STS benchmark to evaluate various\\nJapanese sentence embedding models using previous state-of-the-art sentence\\nrepresentation learning methods.\\nWe first collect a target domain corpus and finetune a pre-trained data\\ngenerator (T5 model) on this unlabeled data to get our target domain data\\ngenerator. Then, based on our relevant content words experiments, we substi-\\ntute all nouns in sentences by the data generator to generate contradictory\\nsentence pairs. Afterward, we use the synthesized target domain training\\ndata with contrastive learning to train a sentence embedding model. We\\nevaluate the models on two domain-specific downstream tasks, one of which\\nuses the QAbot dataset originally collected by us. Our method achieves\\nsignificantly better performance after the domain adaptation training, com-\\npared with direct transfer and current state-of-the-arts in Japanese. We\\nbelieve that JCSE paves a practicable way for domain-specific downstream\\ntasks in low-resource languages.\\n21', doc_id='66d084da-4467-4670-8808-a3e040a382fb', embedding=None, doc_hash='c4cef132d4c13e75783306ffcdb7bbea26a64eb9c775256a688fdf45f6718daa', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='Our future work includes the establishment of a new Japanese STS bench-\\nmark based on human annotation, in contrast to the current benchmark\\nbased on machine translation.

I NTRODUCTION\\nConversational large language models (LLMs) [1], such as\\nChatGPT [2], have generated immense interest in a range\\nof domains for tasks ranging from answering questions on\\nmedical licensing exams [3] to generating code snippets. Th is\\npaper focuses on enhancing the application of LLMs in severa l\\ndomains, such as helping developers code effectively and\\nefﬁciently with unfamiliar APIs or allowing students to acq uire\\nnew coding skills and techniques.\\nLLMs are particularly promising in domains where humans\\nand AI tools work together as trustworthy collaborators to\\nmore rapidly and reliably evolve software-reliant systems [4].\\nFor example, LLMs are being integrated directly into softwa re\\ntools, such as Github’s Co-Pilot [5]–[7] and included in int e-\\ngrated development environments (IDEs), such as IntelliJ [ 8]\\nand Visual Studio Code, thereby allowing software teams to\\naccess these tools directly from their preferred IDE.\\nA prompt [9] is a set of instructions provided to an\\nLLM that programs the LLM by customizing it and/or en-\\nhancing or reﬁning its capabilities . A prompt can inﬂuence\\nsubsequent interactions with—and output generated from—a nLLM by providing speciﬁc rules and guidelines for an LLM\\nconversation with a set of initial rules. In particular, a pr ompt\\nsets the context for the conversation and tells the LLM what\\ninformation is important and what the desired output form an d\\ncontent should be.\\nFor example, a prompt could specify that an LLM should\\nonly generate code that follows a certain coding style or\\nprogramming paradigm. Likewise, it could specify that an\\nLLM should ﬂag certain keywords or phrases in a generated\\ndocument and provide additional information related to tho se\\nkeywords. By introducing these guidelines, prompts facili tate\\nmore structured and nuanced outputs to aid a large variety of\\nsoftware engineering tasks in the context of LLMs.\\nPrompt engineering is the means by which LLMs are\\nprogrammed via prompts. To demonstrate the power of\\nprompt engineering, we provide the following prompt:\\nPrompt: “From now on, I would like you to ask me\\nquestions to deploy a Python application to AWS.\\nWhen you have enough information to deploy the\\napplication, create a Python script to automate the\\ndeployment.”\\nThis example prompt causes ChatGPT to begin asking the\\nuser questions about their software application. ChatGPT w ill\\ndrive the question-asking process until it reaches a point w here\\nit has sufﬁcient information to generate a Python script tha t\\nautomates deployment. This example demonstrates the pro-\\ngramming potential of prompts beyond conventional “genera te\\na method that does X” style prompts or “answer this quiz\\nquestion”.\\nMoreover, prompts can be engineered to program an LLM\\nto accomplish much more than simply dictating the output typ e\\nor ﬁltering the information provided to the model. With the\\nright prompt, it is possible to create entirely new interact ion\\nparadigms, such as having an LLM generate and give a quiz\\nassociated with a software engineering concept or tool, or\\neven simulate a Linux terminal window. Moreover, prompts\\nhave the potential for self-adaptation, suggesting other p rompts\\nto gather additional information or generate related artif acts.\\nThese advanced capabilities of prompts highlight the impor -\\ntance of engineering them to provide value beyond simple tex t\\nor code generation.\\nPrompt patterns are essential to effective prompt engi-\\nneering.

C OMPARING SOFTWARE PATTERNS\\nWITH PROMPT PATTERNS\\nThe quality of the output(s) generated by a conversational\\nLLM is directly related to the quality of the prompts provide d\\nby the user. As discussed in Section I, the prompts given to\\na conversational LLM can be used to program interactions\\nbetween a user and an LLM to better solve a variety of\\nproblems. One contribution of this paper is the framework it\\nprovides to document patterns that structure prompts to sol ve\\na range of software tasks that can be adapted to different\\ndomains.\\nThis framework is useful since it focuses on codifying\\npatterns that can be applied to help users better interact\\nwith conversational LLMs in a variety of contexts, rather\\nthan simply discussing interesting examples or domain-spe ciﬁc\\nprompts. Codifying this knowledge in pattern form enhances\\nreuse and transferability to other contexts and domains whe re\\nusers face similar—but not identical—problems.\\nThe topic of knowledge transfer has been studied exten-\\nsively in the software patterns literature [10], [11] at mul tiple\\nlevels, e.g., design, architectural, and analysis. This paper\\napplies a variant of a familiar pattern form as the basis of\\nour prompt engineering approach. Since prompts are a form\\nof programming, it is natural to document them in pattern\\nform.\\nA. Overview of Software Patterns\\nA software pattern provides a reusable solution to a recur-\\nring problem within a particular context [10]. Documenting\\nsoftware patterns concisely conveys (and generalizes) fro m\\nspeciﬁc problems being addressed to identify important for ces\\nand/or requirements that should be resolved and/or address ed\\nin successful solutions.\\nA pattern form also includes guidance on how to implement\\nthe pattern, as well as information on the trade-offs and\\nconsiderations to take into account when implementing a\\npattern. Moreover, example applications of the pattern are\\noften provided to further showcase the pattern’s utility in\\npractice. Software patterns are typically documented in astylized form to facilitate their use and understanding, su ch\\nas:\\n•A name and classiﬁcation . Each pattern has a name that\\nidentiﬁes the pattern and should be used consistently. A\\nclassiﬁcation groups patterns into broad categories, such\\nas creational, structural, or behavioral.\\n•The intent concisely conveys the purpose the pattern is\\nintended to achieve.\\n•The motivation documents the underlying problem the\\npattern is meant to solve and the importance of the\\nproblem.\\n•The structure and participants . The structure describes\\nthe different pattern participants (such as classes and\\nobjects) and how they collaborate to form a generalized\\nsolution.\\n•Example code concretely maps the pattern to some\\nunderlying programming language(s) and aids developers\\nin gaining greater insight into how that pattern can be\\napplied effectively.\\n•Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern in practice.\\nB. Overview of Prompt Patterns\\nPrompt patterns are similar to software patterns in that the y\\noffer reusable solutions to speciﬁc problems. They focus mo re\\nspeciﬁcally, however, on the context of output generation f rom\\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Just\\nas software patterns provide a codiﬁed approach to solving\\ncommon software development challenges, prompt patterns\\nprovide a codiﬁed approach to customizing the output and\\ninteractions of LLMs.\\nBy documenting and leveraging prompt patterns in the\\ncontext of automating software development tasks, individ ual\\nusers and teams can enforce constraints on the generated\\noutput, ensure that relevant information is included, and\\nchange the format of interaction with the LLM to better\\nsolve problems they face. Prompt patterns can be viewed as a\\ncorollary to the broad corpus of general software patterns, just\\nadapted to the more speciﬁc context of LLM output generation .\\nPrompt patterns follow a similar format to classic software\\npatterns, with slight modiﬁcations to match the context of\\noutput generation with LLMs.1Each of the analogous sections\\nfor the prompt pattern form used in this paper is summarized\\nbelow:\\n•A name and classiﬁcation . The prompt pattern name\\nuniquely identiﬁes the pattern and ideally indicates the\\nproblem that is being addressed. For the classiﬁcation,\\nwe have developed a series of initial categories of pattern\\ntypes, which are summarized in Table I and include\\nOutput Customization ,Error Identiﬁcation ,Prompt\\nImprovement ,Interaction , and Context Control .\\n•The intent and context describes the problem the prompt\\npattern solves and the goals it achieves.

The motivation\\nis explained in the context of users interacting with a\\nconversational LLM and how it can improve upon users\\ninformally prompting the LLM in one or more circum-\\nstances. Speciﬁc circumstances where the improvements\\nare expected are documented.\\n•The structure and key ideas . The structure describes\\nthe fundamental contextual information, as a series of\\nkey ideas, that the prompt pattern provides to the LLM.\\nThese ideas are similar to “participants” in a software pat-\\ntern. The contextual information may be communicated\\nthrough varying wording (just as a software pattern can\\nhave variations in how it is realized in code), but should\\nhave fundamental pieces of information that form a core\\nelement of the pattern.\\n•Example implementation demonstrates how the prompt\\npattern is worded in practice.\\n•Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern and may provide guidance on how to adapt\\nthe prompt to different contexts.\\nC. Evaluating Means for Deﬁning a Prompt Pattern’s Struc-\\nture and Ideas\\nIn software patterns, the structure and participants are\\nnormally deﬁned in terms of UML diagrams, such as structure\\ndiagrams and/or interaction diagrams. These UML diagrams\\nexplain what the participants of the pattern are and how they\\ninteract to solve the problem. In prompt patterns, somethin g\\nanalogous is needed, though UML may not be an appro-\\npriate structural documentation approach since it is inten ded\\nto describe software structures, as opposed to the ideas to\\ncommunicate in a prompt.\\nSeveral possible approaches could be used, ranging from di-\\nagrams to deﬁning grammars for a prompt language. Although\\ngrammars may seem attractive due to their formal nature, the y\\nalso incur the following challenges:\\n•The goal of prompts is to communicate knowledge in a\\nclear and concise way to conversation LLM users, who\\nmay or may not be computer scientists or programmers.\\nAs a community, we should strive to create an approach-\\nable format that communicates knowledge clearly to a\\ndiverse target audience.\\n•It is possible to phrase a prompt in many different ways.\\nIt is hard, however, to deﬁne a grammar that accurately\\nand completely expresses all the nuanced ways that\\ncomponents of a prompt could be expressed in text or\\nsymbols.\\n•Prompts fundamentally convey ideas to a conversational\\nLLM and are not simply the production of tokens for\\ninput. In particular, an idea built into a prompt pattern\\ncan be communicated in many ways and its expressionshould be at a higher-level than the underlying tokens\\nrepresenting the idea.\\n•It is possible to program an LLM to introduce novel\\nsemantics for statements and words that create new ways\\nfor communicating an idea. In contrast, grammars may\\nnot easily represent ideas that can be expressed through\\ncompletely new symbology or languages that the gram-\\nmar designer was not aware of.\\nD. A Way Forward: Fundamental Contextual Statements\\nAn open research question, therefore, is what approach is\\nmore effective than formal grammars for describing prompt\\npattern structure and ideas. We propose the concept of funda-\\nmental contextual statements , which are written descriptions\\nof the important ideas to communicate in a prompt to an LLM.\\nAn idea can be rewritten and expressed in arbitrary ways base d\\non user needs and experience. The key ideas to communicate,\\nhowever, are presented to the user as a series of simple, but\\nfundamental, statements.\\nOne beneﬁt of adopting and applying the fundamental con-\\ntextual statements approach is that it is intentionally int uitive\\nto users. In particular, we expect users will understand how to\\nexpress and adapt the statements in a contextually appropri ate\\nway for their domain. Moreover, since the underlying ideas o f\\nthe prompt are captured, these same ideas can be expressed\\nby the user in alternate symbology or wording that has been\\nintroduced to the LLM using patterns, such as the Meta\\nLanguage Creation pattern presented in Section III-B.\\nOur ultimate goal is to enhance prompt engineering by\\nproviding a framework for designing prompts that can be\\nreused and/or adapted to other LLMs in the same way that\\nsoftware patterns can be implemented in different program-\\nming languages and platforms. For the purposes of this paper ,\\nhowever, all prompts were tested with ChatGPT [12] using the\\nChatGPT+ service. We use ChatGPT as the LLM for all exam-\\nples presented in this paper due to its widespread availabil ity\\nand popularity. These examples were documented through a\\ncombination of exploring the corpus of community-posted\\nprompts on the Internet and independent prompt creation fro m\\nour use of ChatGPT to automating software development\\ntasks.\\nIII. A C ATALOG OF PROMPT PATTERNS\\nFOR CONVERSATIONAL LLM S\\nThis section presents our catalog of prompt patterns that\\nhave been applied to solve common problems in the domain\\nof conversational LLM interaction and output generation fo r\\nautomating software tasks. Each prompt pattern is accompa-\\nnied by concrete implementation samples and examples with\\nand without the prompt.\\nA. Summary of the Prompt Pattern Catalog\\nThe classiﬁcation of prompt patterns is an important consid -\\neration in documenting the patterns.

This category in-\\ncludes the Meta Language Creation pattern, which focuses on\\ncreating a custom language for the LLM to understand. This\\npattern is useful when the default input language is ill-sui ted\\nfor expressing ideas the user wants to convey to the LLM.\\nTheOutput Customization category focuses on constrain-\\ning or tailoring the types, formats, structure, or other pro perties\\nof the output generated by the LLM. The prompt patterns in\\nthis category include Output Automater ,Persona ,Visualiza-\\ntion Generator ,Recipe , and Template patterns. The Output\\nAutomater pattern allows the user to create scripts that can\\nautomate any tasks the LLM output suggests the user should\\nperform. The Persona pattern gives the LLM a persona or role\\nto play when generating output. The Visualization Generator\\npattern allows the user to generate visualizations by produ cing\\ntextual outputs that can be fed to other tools, such as other\\nAI-based image generators, like DALL-E [13]. The Recipe\\npattern allows the user to obtain a sequence of steps or actio ns\\nto realize a stated end result, possibly with partially know n\\ninformation or constraints. The Template pattern allows the\\nuser to specify a template for the output, which the LLM ﬁlls\\nin with content.\\nThe Error Identiﬁcation category focuses on identifying\\nand resolving errors in the output generated by the LLM. Thiscategory includes the Fact Check List andReﬂection patterns.\\nThe Fact Check List pattern requires the LLM to generate a\\nlist of facts the output depends on that should be fact-check ed.\\nThe Reﬂection pattern requires the LLM to introspect on its\\noutput and identify any errors.\\nThe Prompt Improvement category focuses on improving\\nthe quality of the input and output. This category includes\\ntheQuestion Reﬁnement ,Alternative Approaches ,Cognitive\\nVeriﬁer , and Refusal Breaker patterns. The Question Reﬁne-\\nment pattern ensures the LLM always suggests a better version\\nof the user’s question. The Alternative Approaches pattern\\nrequires the LLM to suggest alternative ways of accomplishi ng\\na user-speciﬁed task. The Cognitive Veriﬁer pattern instructs\\nthe LLM to automatically suggest a series of subquestions\\nfor the user to answer before combining the answers to the\\nsubquestions and producing an answer to the overall questio n.\\nTheRefusal Breaker pattern requires the LLM to automatically\\nreword the user’s question when it refuses to produce an\\nanswer.\\nThe Interaction category focuses on the interaction be-\\ntween the user and the LLM. This category includes the\\nFlipped Interaction ,Game Play , and Inﬁnite Generation pat-\\nterns. The Flipped Interaction pattern requires the LLM to\\nask questions rather than generate output. The Game Play\\npattern requires the LLM to generate output in the form of\\na game. The Inﬁnite Generation pattern requires the LLM to\\ngenerate output indeﬁnitely without the user having to reen ter\\nthe generator prompt each time.\\nFinally, the Context Control category focuses on control-\\nling the contextual information in which the LLM operates.\\nThis category includes the Context Manager pattern, which\\nallows the user to specify the context for the LLM’s output.\\nThe remainder of this section describes each of these prompt\\npatterns using the pattern form discussed in Section II-B.\\nB. The Meta Language Creation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: During a conversation with an LLM,\\nthe user would like to create the prompt via an alternate\\nlanguage, such as a textual short-hand notation for graphs, a\\ndescription of states and state transitions for a state mach ine, a\\nset of commands for prompt automation, etc. The intent of thi s\\npattern is to explain the semantics of this alternative lang uage\\nto the LLM so the user can write future prompts using this\\nnew language and its semantics.\\n2) Motivation: Many problems, structures, or other ideas\\ncommunicated in a prompt may be more concisely, unam-\\nbiguously, or clearly expressed in a language other than\\nEnglish (or whatever conventional human language is used\\nto interact with an LLM). To produce output based on an\\nalternative language, however, an LLM needs to understand\\nthe language’s semantics.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen I say X, I mean Y (or would like you to do Y)', doc_id='08c348f7-fa2b-4516-981f-be8ba98a7056', embedding=None, doc_hash='000d96583f3ba45b2481d2f1e8db97e9e3b379794fe73e22128508833154ee6a', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='The key structure of this pattern involves explaining the\\nmeaning of one or more symbols, words, or statements to\\nthe LLM so it uses the provided semantics for the ensuing\\nconversation. This description can take the form of a simple\\ntranslation, such as “X” means “Y”. The description can also\\ntake more complex forms that deﬁne a series of commands\\nand their semantics, such as “when I say X, I want you to do\\n”. In this case, “X” is henceforth bound to the semantics of\\n“take action”.\\n4) Example Implementation: The key to successfully using\\ntheMeta Language Creation pattern is developing an unam-\\nbiguous notation or shorthand, such as the following:\\n“From now on, whenever I type two identiﬁers\\nseparated by a “ →”, I am describing a graph. For\\nexample, “a →b” is describing a graph with nodes\\n“a” and “b” and an edge between them. If I separate\\nidentiﬁers by “-[w:2, z:3] →”, I am adding properties\\nof the edge, such as a weight or label.”\\nThis example of the Meta Language Creation pattern estab-\\nlishes a standardized notation for describing graphs by deﬁ ning\\na convention for representing nodes and edges. Whenever the\\nauthor types two identiﬁers separated by a “ →” symbol, it is\\nan indication that a graph is being described. For example, i f\\nthe author types “a →b”, this indicates that a graph is being\\ndeﬁned with nodes “a” and “b”, and that there is an edge\\nbetween them. This convention provides a clear and concise\\nway to communicate the structure of a graph in written form.\\nMoreover, the prompt goes on to specify that additional\\ninformation about the edges, such as a weight or label, can\\nbe provided using the syntax “-[w:2, z:3] →”. This notation\\nallows for the speciﬁcation of additional properties beyon d\\nthe basic structure of the graph. The speciﬁed properties ar e\\nassociated with the edge between the two nodes and can\\nprovide important context for the interpretation of the gra ph.\\nThis standardized notation for describing graphs can make i t\\neasier to communicate graph structures and properties, whi ch\\nmay not be easy or are very verbose to describe as a series of\\nsentences.\\n5) Consequences: Although this pattern provides a pow-\\nerful means to customize a user’s interaction with an LLM,\\nit may create the potential for confusion within the LLM.\\nAs important as it is to clearly deﬁne the semantics of the\\nlanguage, it is also essential to ensure the language itself\\nintroduces no ambiguities that degrade the LLM’s performan ce\\nor accuracy. For example, the prompt “whenever I separate\\ntwo things by commas, it means that the ﬁrst thing precedes\\nthe second thing” will likely create signiﬁcant potential f or\\nambiguity and create the potential for unexpected semantic s\\nif punctuation involving commas is used in the prompt.\\nTo showcase the potential for confusion, ChatGPT will\\nwarn the user and potentially be unable to perform a speciﬁc\\nmapping of a symbol or term to a new meaning. For example,\\nif following prompt is given to ChatGPT\\n“Whenever I say “a”, I am referring to Marie An-\\ntoinette.”it will respond that this prompt creates too much confusion\\nas “a” is an indeﬁnite article and too commonly used, as shown\\nbelow:\\n“Referring to Marie Antoinette using “a” could\\npotentially cause confusion, as “a” is an indeﬁnite\\narticle commonly used to refer to a noun that has\\nnot been mentioned before. It may be more clear\\nto use her name, “Marie Antoinette”, or a pronoun\\nsuch as “she” or “her” to refer to her. Moreover,\\nusing context to establish who you are referring to\\ncan also help avoid confusion in conversation.”\\nIn general, an LLM will perform better on data it was\\ntrained on. Therefore, when an existing notation is availab le—\\nbut may not be the dominant meaning—the Meta Language\\nCreation pattern can provide context to scope the meaning of\\nthe symbol to improve the accurately and utility of the outpu t.\\nFor example, the symbol “ →” conveys slightly different infor-\\nmation in graphs and propositional logic. The statement “p →\\nq, q→p” may therefore make sense, but only if the LLM\\nis given the appropriate context through a Meta Language\\nCreation prompt.\\nAlthough Meta Language Creation is a powerful pattern it\\nmust be used carefully, particularly when describing conce pts\\nthat may otherwise be hard to precisely or concisely describ e.\\nThese types of prompts are thus best used in completely\\nnew conversation sessions. Using a single meta-language-p er-\\nconversation session may also be a best practice since it avo ids\\nthe potential for conﬂicting or unexpected semantics being\\napplied to the conversation over time.\\nC. The Output Automater Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to have\\nthe LLM generate a script or other automation artifact that c an\\nautomatically perform any steps it recommends taking as par t\\nof its output. The goal is to reduce the manual effort needed\\nto implement any LLM output recommendations.\\n2) Motivation: The output of an LLM is often a sequence\\nof steps for the user to follow. For example, when asking an\\nLLM to generate a Python conﬁguration script it may suggest\\na number of ﬁles to modify and changes to apply to each ﬁle.\\nHowever, having users continually perform the manual steps\\ndictated by LLM output is tedious and error-prone.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you produce an output that has at least one\\nstep to take and the following properties (alternatively,\\nalways do this)\\nProduce an executable artifact of type X that will\\nautomate these steps\\nThe ﬁrst part of the pattern identiﬁes the situations under\\nwhich automation should be generated. A simple approach\\nis to state that the output includes at least two steps to\\ntake and that an automation artifact should be produced. The', doc_id='2ad89fea-eae1-4dca-9c66-6e3b93c3a444', embedding=None, doc_hash='684de12b4526594ee7d9e700e993b84c75be9bf023e038d8dcfd1a00f2d61acc', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='scoping is up to the user, but helps prevent producing an\\noutput automation scripts in cases where running the output\\nautomation script will take more user effort than performin g\\nthe original steps produced in the output. The scope can be\\nlimited to outputs requiring more than a certain number of\\nsteps.\\nThe next part of this pattern provides a concrete statement\\nof the type of output the LLM should output to perform the\\nautomation. For example, “produce a Python script” gives th e\\nLLM a concrete understanding to translate the general steps\\ninto equivalent steps in Python. The automation artifact sh ould\\nbe concrete and must be something that the LLM associates\\nwith the action of “automating a sequence of steps”.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample of this prompt pat-\\ntern applied to code snippets generated by the ChatGPT LLM\\nis shown below:\\n“From now on, whenever you generate code that\\nspans more than one ﬁle, generate a Python script\\nthat can be run to automatically create the speciﬁed\\nﬁles or make changes to existing ﬁles to insert the\\ngenerated code.”\\nThis pattern is particularly effective in software enginee ring\\nas a common task for software engineers using LLMs is to\\nthen copy/paste the outputs into multiple ﬁles. Some tools,\\nsuch as Copilot, insert limited snippets directly into the s ection\\nof code that the coder is working with, but tools, such as\\nChatGPT, do not provide these facilities. This automation t rick\\nis also effective at creating scripts for running commands o n\\na terminal, automating cloud operations, or reorganizing ﬁ les\\non a ﬁle system.\\nThis pattern is a powerful complement for any system that\\ncan be computer controlled. The LLM can provide a set of\\nsteps that should be taken on the computer-controlled syste m\\nand then the output can be translated into a script that allow s\\nthe computer controlling the system to automatically take\\nthe steps. This is a direct pathway to allowing LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, to integrate quality into—and to control—new\\ncomputing systems that have a known scripting interface.\\n5) Consequences: An important usage consideration of\\nthis pattern is that the automation artifact must be deﬁned\\nconcretely. Without a concrete meaning for how to “automate ”\\nthe steps, the LLM often states that it “can’t automate thing s”\\nsince that is beyond its capabilities. LLMs typically accep t\\nrequests to produce code, however, so the goal is to instruct the\\nLLM to generate text/code, which can be executed to automate\\nsomething. This subtle distinction in meaning is important to\\nhelp an LLM disambiguate the prompt meaning.\\nOne caveat of the Output Automater pattern is the LLM\\nneeds sufﬁcient conversational context to generate an auto ma-\\ntion artifact that is functional in the target context, such as\\nthe ﬁle system of a project on a Mac vs. Windows computer.\\nThis pattern works best when the full context needed for the\\nautomation is contained within the conversation, e.g., when\\na software application is generated from scratch using the\\nconversation and all actions on the local ﬁle system are\\nperformed using a sequence of generated automation artifac tsrather than manual actions unknown to the LLM. Alternativel y,\\nself-contained sequences of steps work well, such as “how do\\nI ﬁnd the list of open ports on my Mac computer”.\\nIn some cases, the LLM may produce a long output with\\nmultiple steps and not include an automation artifact. This\\nomission may arise for various reasons, including exceedin g\\nthe output length limitation the LLM supports. A simple\\nworkaround for this situation is to remind the LLM via a\\nfollow-on prompt, such as “But you didn’t automate it”, whic h\\nprovides the context that the automation artifact was omitt ed\\nand should be generated.\\nAt this point in the evolution of LLMs, the Output Auto-\\nmater pattern is best employed by users who can read and\\nunderstand the generated automation artifact. LLMs can (an d\\ndo) produce inaccuracies in their output, so blindly accept ing\\nand executing an automation artifact carries signiﬁcant ri sk.\\nAlthough this pattern may alleviate the user from performin g\\ncertain manual steps, it does not alleviate their responsib ility\\nto understand the actions they undertake using the output.\\nWhen users execute automation scripts, therefore they assu me\\nresponsibility for the outcomes.\\nD. The Flipped Interaction Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: You want the LLM to ask questions\\nto obtain the information it needs to perform some tasks.\\nRather than the user driving the conversation, therefore, y ou\\nwant the LLM to drive the conversation to focus it on\\nachieving a speciﬁc goal. For example, you may want the\\nLLM to give you a quick quiz or automatically ask questions\\nuntil it has sufﬁcient information to generate a deployment\\nscript for your application to a particular cloud environme nt.\\n2) Motivation: Rather than having the user drives a con-\\nversation, an LLM often has knowledge it can use to more\\naccurately obtain information from the user. The goal of the\\nFlipped Interaction pattern is to ﬂip the interaction ﬂow so the\\nLLM asks the user questions to achieve some desired goal. The\\nLLM can often better select the format, number, and content\\nof the interactions to ensure that the goal is reached faster ,\\nmore accurately, and/or by using knowledge the user may not\\n(initially) possess.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to ask me questions to achieve X\\nYou should ask questions until this condition is met or\\nto achieve this goal (alternatively, forever)\\n(Optional) ask me the questions one at a time, two at\\na time, etc.\\nA prompt for a ﬂipped interaction should always specify the\\ngoal of the interaction. The ﬁrst idea ( i.e., you want the LLM to\\nask questions to achieve a goal) communicates this goal to th e\\nLLM. Equally important is that the questions should focus on a\\nparticular topic or outcome. By providing the goal, the LLM\\ncan understand what it is trying to accomplish through the\\ninteraction and tailor its questions accordingly. This “in version', doc_id='a2922cdb-595a-4659-b8ce-f6d850e55c2c', embedding=None, doc_hash='1d6f99c4b35e38b563ab635e73e7b1e19284c7595891cc6485bfa4566e4f9454', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='of control” enables more focused and efﬁcient interaction s ince\\nthe LLM will only ask questions that it deems relevant to\\nachieving the speciﬁed goal.\\nThe second idea provides the context for how long the in-\\nteraction should occur. A ﬂipped interaction can be termina ted\\nwith a response like “stop asking questions”. It is often bet ter,\\nhowever, to scope the interaction to a reasonable length or\\nonly as far as is needed to reach the goal. This goal can be\\nsurprisingly open-ended and the LLM will continue to work\\ntowards the goal by asking questions, as is the case in the\\nexample of ”until you have enough information to generate a\\nPython script”.\\nBy default, the LLM is likely to generate multiple questions\\nper iteration. The third idea is completely optional, but ca n\\nimprove usability by limiting (or expanding) the number of\\nquestions that the LLM generates per cycle. If a precise\\nnumber/format for the questioning is not speciﬁed, the ques -\\ntioning will be semi-random and may lead to one-at-a-time\\nquestions or ten-at-a-time questions. The prompt can thus b e\\ntailored to include the number of questions asked at a time,\\nthe order of the questions, and any other formatting/orderi ng\\nconsiderations to facilitate user interaction.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample prompt for a ﬂipped\\ninteraction is shown below:\\n“From now on, I would like you to ask me questions\\nto deploy a Python application to AWS. When you\\nhave enough information to deploy the application,\\ncreate a Python script to automate the deployment.”\\nIn general, the more speciﬁc the prompt regarding the\\nconstraints and information to collect, the better the outc ome.\\nFor instance, the example prompt above could provide a menu\\nof possible AWS services (such as Lambda, EC2, etc.) with\\nwhich to deploy the application. In other cases, the LLM may\\nbe permitted to simply make appropriate choices on its own fo r\\nthings that the user doesn’t explicitly make decisions abou t.\\nOne limitation of this prompt is that, once other contextual\\ninformation is provided regarding the task, it may require\\nexperimentation with the precise phrasing to get the LLM to\\nask the questions in the appropriate number and ﬂow to best\\nsuit the task, such as asking multiple questions at once vers us\\none question at a time.\\n5) Consequences: One consideration when designing the\\nprompt is how much to dictate to the LLM regarding what\\ninformation to collect prior to termination. In the example\\nabove, the ﬂipped interaction is open-ended and can vary sig -\\nniﬁcantly in the ﬁnal generated artifact. This open-endedn ess\\nmakes the prompt generic and reusable, but may potentially\\nask additional questions that could be skipped if more conte xt\\nis given.\\nIf speciﬁc requirements are known in advance, it is better to\\ninject them into the prompt rather than hoping the LLM will\\nobtain the needed information. Otherwise, the LLM will non-\\nnondeterministically decide whether to prompt the user for the\\ninformation or make an educated guess as to an appropriate\\nvalue.For example, the user can state that they would like to\\ndeploy an application to Amazon AWS EC2, rather than\\nsimply state ”the cloud” and require multiple interactions to\\nnarrow down the deployment target. The more precise the\\ninitial information, the better the LLM can use the limited\\nquestions that a user is likely willing to answer to obtain\\ninformation to improve its output.\\nWhen developing prompts for ﬂipped interactions, it is im-\\nportant to consider the level of user knowledge, engagement ,\\nand control. If the goal is to accomplish the goal with as litt le\\nuser interaction as possible (minimal control), that shoul d be\\nstated explicitly.Conversely, if the goal is to ensure the u ser\\nis aware of all key decisions and conﬁrms them (maximum\\nengagement) that should also be stated explicitly. Likewis e, if\\nthe user is expected to have minimal knowledge and should\\nhave the questions targeted at their level of expertise, thi s\\ninformation should be engineered into the prompt.\\nE. The Persona Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: In many cases, users would like\\nLLM output to always take a certain point of view or per-\\nspective. For example, it may be useful for to conduct a code\\nreview as if the LLM was a security expert. The intent of this\\npattern is to give the LLM a “persona” that helps it select wha t\\ntypes of output to generate and what details to focus on.\\n2) Motivation: Users may not know what types of outputs\\nor details are important for an LLM to focus on to achieve\\na given task. They may know, however, the role or type of\\nperson that they would normally ask to get help with these\\nthings. The Persona pattern enables the users to express what\\nthey need help with without knowing the exact details of the\\noutputs they need.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nAct as persona X\\nProvide outputs that persona X would create\\nThe ﬁrst statement conveys the idea that the LLM needs\\nto act as a speciﬁc persona and provide outputs that such a\\npersona would. This persona can be expressed in a number\\nof ways, ranging from a job description, title, ﬁctional cha r-\\nacter, historical ﬁgure, etc. The persona should elicit a se t\\nof attributes associated with a well-known job title, type o f\\nperson, etc.2\\nThe secondary idea—provide outputs that persona X would\\ncreate—offers opportunities for customization. For examp le, a\\nteacher might provide a large variety of different output ty pes,\\nranging from assignments to reading lists to lectures. If a m ore\\nspeciﬁc scope to the type of output is known, the user can\\nprovide it in this statement.\\n2Be aware, however, that personas relating to living people o r people\\nconsidered harmful make be disregarded due to underlying LL M privacy and\\nsecurity rules.', doc_id='53b1cf16-8044-4c10-bf64-33f9b794b82c', embedding=None, doc_hash='f67b5e5bc87de7429256da95d6cc068e3107879586ed0ea97e226c3bd3e2ea91', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='4) Example Implementation: A sample implementation for\\ncode review is shown below:\\n“From now on, act as a security reviewer. Pay close\\nattention to the security details of any code that\\nwe look at. Provide outputs that a security reviewer\\nwould regarding the code.”\\nIn this example, the LLM is instructed to provide outputs\\nthat a ”security reviewer” would. The prompt further sets th e\\nstage that code is going to be evaluated. Finally, the user\\nreﬁnes the persona by scoping the persona further to outputs\\nregarding the code.\\nPersonas can also represent inanimate or non-human en-\\ntities, such as a Linux terminal, a database, or an animal’s\\nperspective. When using this pattern to represent these ent ities,\\nit can be useful to also specify how you want the inputs\\ndelivered to the entity, such as “assume my input is what the\\nowner is saying to the dog and your output is the sounds the\\ndog is making”. An example prompt for a non-human entity\\nthat uses a “pretend to be” wording is shown below:\\n“You are going to pretend to be a Linux terminal\\nfor a computer that has been compromised by an\\nattacker. When I type in a command, you are going\\nto output the corresponding text that the Linux\\nterminal would produce.”\\nThis prompt is designed to simulate a computer that has\\nbeen compromised by an attacker and is being controlled\\nthrough a Linux terminal. The prompt speciﬁes that the user\\nwill input commands into the terminal, and in response, the\\nsimulated terminal will output the corresponding text that\\nwould be produced by a real Linux terminal. This prompt\\nis more prescriptive in the persona and asks the LLM to, not\\nonly be a Linux terminal, but to further act as a computer that\\nhas been compromised by an attacker.\\nThe persona causes ChatGPT to generate outputs to com-\\nmands that have ﬁles and contents indicative of a computer th at\\nwas hacked. The example illustrates how an LLM can bring\\nits situational awareness to a persona, in this case, creati ng\\nevidence of a cyberattack in the outputs it generates. This\\ntype of persona can be very effective for combining with the\\nGame Play pattern, where you want the exact details of the\\noutput characteristics to be hidden from the user (e.g., don ’t\\ngive away what the cyberattack did by describing it explicit ly\\nin the prompt).\\n5) Consequences: An interesting aspect of taking non-\\nhuman personas is that the LLM may make interesting as-\\nsumptions or “hallucinations” regarding the context. A wid ely\\ncirculated example on the Internet asks ChatGPT to act as\\na Linux terminal and produce the expected output that you\\nwould get if the user typed the same text into a terminal.\\nCommands, such as ls -l , will generate a ﬁle listing for an\\nimaginary UNIX ﬁle system, complete with ﬁles that can have\\ncat file1.txt run on them.\\nIn other examples, the LLM may prompt the user for more\\ncontext, such as when ChatGPT is asked to act as a MySQL\\ndatabase and prompts for the structure of a table that the use ris pretending to query. ChatGPT can then generate synthetic\\nrows, such as generating imaginary rows for a “people” table\\nwith columns for “name” and “job”.\\nF . The Question Reﬁnement Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern engages the LLM in\\nthe prompt engineering process. The intent of this pattern i s\\nto ensure the conversational LLM always suggests potential ly\\nbetter or more reﬁned questions the user could ask instead of\\ntheir original question. Using this pattern, the LLM can aid the\\nuser in ﬁnding the right question to ask in order to arrive at a n\\naccurate answer. In addition, the LLM may help the user ﬁnd\\nthe information or achieve their goal in fewer interactions with\\nthe user than if the user employed trial and error prompting.\\n2) Motivation: If a user is asking a question, it is possible\\nthey are not an expert in the domain and may not know the\\nbest way to phrase the question or be aware of additional\\ninformation helpful in phrasing the question. LLMs will oft en\\nstate limitations on the answer they are providing or reques t\\nadditional information to help them produce a more accurate\\nanswer. An LLM may also state assumptions it made in\\nproviding the answer. The motivation is that this additiona l\\ninformation or set of assumptions could be used to generate\\na better prompt. Rather than requiring the user to digest\\nand rephrase their prompt with the additional information,\\nthe LLM can directly reﬁne the prompt to incorporate the\\nadditional information.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, suggest a better version of the question\\nto use instead\\n(Optional) prompt me if I would like to use the better\\nversion instead\\nThe ﬁrst contextual statement in the prompt is asking the\\nLLM to suggest a better version of a question within a speciﬁc\\nscope. The scope is provided to ensure that not all questions\\nare automatically reworded or that they are reﬁned with a\\ngiven goal. The second contextual statement is meant for\\nautomation and allows the user to automatically use the reﬁn ed\\nquestion without having to copy/paste or manually enter it. The\\nengineering of this prompt can be further reﬁned by combinin g\\nit with the Reﬂection pattern, which allows the LLM to explain\\nwhy it believes the reﬁned question is an improvement.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question about a\\nsoftware artifact’s security, suggest a better version\\nof the question to use that incorporates information\\nspeciﬁc to security risks in the language or frame-\\nwork that I am using instead and ask me if I would\\nlike to use your question instead.”\\nIn the context of the example above, the LLM will use\\ntheQuestion Reﬁnement pattern to improve security-related\\nquestions by asking for or using speciﬁc details about the', doc_id='fe02ab59-8b67-46dc-b926-e23eab45fc57', embedding=None, doc_hash='21c78889980f53991f4cd3fea45ad3f9a6a091529a3e7b55bd7c8223d0e34d79', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='software artifact and the language or framework used to buil d\\nit. For instance, if a developer of a Python web application w ith\\nFastAPI asks ChatGPT “How do I handle user authentication\\nin my web application?”, the LLM will reﬁne the question\\nby taking into account that the web application is written in\\nPython with FastAPI. The LLM then provides a revised ques-\\ntion that is more speciﬁc to the language and framework, such\\nas “What are the best practices for handling user authentica tion\\nsecurely in a FastAPI web application to mitigate common\\nsecurity risks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross- site\\nrequest forgery (CSRF), and session hijacking?”\\nThe additional detail in the revised question is likely\\nto not only make the user aware of issues they need to\\nconsider, but lead to a better answer from the LLM. For\\nsoftware engineering tasks, this pattern could also incorp orate\\ninformation regarding potential bugs, modularity, or othe r\\ncode quality considerations. Another approach would be to\\nautomatically reﬁne questions so the generated code cleanl y\\nseparates concerns or minimizes use of external libraries, such\\nas:\\nWhenever I ask a question about how to write some\\ncode, suggest a better version of my question that\\nasks how to write the code in a way that minimizes\\nmy dependencies on external libraries.\\n5) Consequences: The Question Reﬁnement pattern helps\\nbridge the gap between the user’s knowledge and the LLM’s\\nunderstanding, thereby yielding more efﬁcient and accurat e\\ninteractions. One risk of this pattern is its tendency to rap idly\\nnarrow the questioning by the user into a speciﬁc area that\\nguides the user down a more limited path of inquiry than\\nnecessary. The consequence of this narrowing is that the\\nuser may miss important ”bigger picture” information. One\\nsolution to this problem is to provide additional scope to th e\\npattern prompt, such as “do not scope my questions to speciﬁc\\nprogramming languages or frameworks.”\\nAnother approach to overcoming arbitrary narrowing or\\nlimited targeting of the reﬁned question is to combine the\\nQuestion Reﬁnement pattern with other patterns. In particular,\\nthis pattern can be combined with the Cognitive Veriﬁer pattern\\nso the LLM automatically produces a series of follow-up ques -\\ntions that can produce the reﬁned question. For example, in\\nthe following prompt the Question Reﬁnement andCognitive\\nVeriﬁer patterns are applied to ensure better questions are\\nposed to the LLM:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion.”\\nAs with many patterns that allow an LLM to generate\\nnew questions using its knowledge, the LLM may introduce\\nunfamiliar terms or concepts to the user into the question.\\nOne way to address this issue is to include a statement that\\nthe LLM should explain any unfamiliar terms it introduces in to\\nthe question. A further enhancement of this idea is to combin etheQuestion Reﬁnement pattern with the Persona pattern so\\nthe LLM ﬂags terms and generates deﬁnitions that assume a\\nparticular level of knowledge, such as this example:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion. After the follow-up questions, temporarily\\nact as a user with no knowledge of AWS and deﬁne\\nany terms that I need to know to accurately answer\\nthe questions.”\\nAn LLM can always produce factual inaccuracies, just\\nlike a human. A risk of this pattern is that the inaccuracies\\nare introduced into the reﬁned question. This risk may be\\nmitigated, however, by combining the Fact Check List pattern\\nto enable the user to identify possible inaccuracies and the\\nReﬂection pattern to explain the reasoning behind the question\\nreﬁnement.\\nG. The Alternative Approaches Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to ensure\\nan LLM always offers alternative ways of accomplishing a tas k\\nso a user does not pursue only the approaches with which they\\nare familiar. The LLM can provide alternative approaches th at\\nalways force the user to think about what they are doing and\\ndetermine if that is the best approach to meet reach their goa l.\\nIn addition, solving the task may inform the user or teach the m\\nabout alternative concepts for subsequent follow-up.\\n2) Motivation: Humans often suffer from cognitive biases\\nthat lead them to choose a particular approach to solve a\\nproblem even when it is not the right or “best” approach.\\nMoreover, humans may be unaware of alternative approaches\\nto what they have used in the past. The motivation of the\\nAlternative Approaches pattern is to ensure the user is aware\\nof alternative approaches to select a better approach to sol ve\\na problem by dissolving their cognitive biases.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, if there are alternative ways to accom-\\nplish the same thing, list the best alternate approaches\\n(Optional) compare/contrast the pros and cons of each\\napproach\\n(Optional) include the original way that I asked\\n(Optional) prompt me for which approach I would like\\nto use\\nThe ﬁrst statement, “within scope X”, scopes the interactio n\\nto a particular goal, topic, or bounds on the questioning. Th e\\nscope is the constraints that the user is placing on the alter -\\nnative approaches. The scope could be “for implementation\\ndecisions” or “for the deployment of the application”. The\\nscope ensures that any alternatives ﬁt within the boundarie s\\nor constraints that the user must adhere to.\\nThe second statement, “if there are alternative ways to\\naccomplish the same thing, list the best alternate approach es”', doc_id='cdeb3277-d3b7-4ed2-a0b4-1b31cee8c95d', embedding=None, doc_hash='099a84568fbde3987575773f6630f72dca898aa83e210226d73500c6fd79bcc6', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='instructs the LLM to suggest alternatives. As with other\\npatterns, the speciﬁcity of the instructions can be increas ed or\\ninclude domain-speciﬁc contextual information. For examp le,\\nthe statement could be scoped to “if there are alternative wa ys\\nto accomplish the same thing with the software framework tha t\\nI am using” to prevent the LLM from suggesting alternatives\\nthat are inherently non-viable because they would require t oo\\nmany changes to other parts of the application.\\nSince the user may not be aware of the alternative ap-\\nproaches, they also may not be aware of why one would\\nchoose one of the alternatives. The optional statement “com -\\npare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach” adds de-\\ncision making criteria to the analysis. This statement ensu res\\nthe LLM will provide the user with the necessary rationale\\nfor alternative approaches. The ﬁnal statement, “prompt me\\nfor which approach I would like to use”, helps eliminate the\\nuser needing to manually copy/paste or enter in an alternati ve\\napproach if one is selected.\\n4) Example Implementation: Example prompt implementa-\\ntion to generate, compare, and allow the user to select one or\\nmore alternative approaches:\\n“Whenever I ask you to deploy an application to\\na speciﬁc cloud service, if there are alternative\\nservices to accomplish the same thing with the\\nsame cloud service provider, list the best alternative\\nservices and then compare/contrast the pros and cons\\nof each approach with respect to cost, availability,\\nand maintenance effort and include the original way\\nthat I asked. Then ask me which approach I would\\nlike to proceed with.”\\nThis implementation of the Alternative Approaches pattern\\nis being speciﬁcally tailored for the context of software\\nengineering and focuses on the deployment of applications\\nto cloud services. The prompt is intended to intercept place s\\nwhere the developer may have made a cloud service selection\\nwithout full awareness of alternative services that may be\\npriced more competitively or easier to maintain. The prompt\\ndirects ChatGPT to list the best alternative services that c an\\naccomplish the same task with the same cloud service provide r\\n(providing constraints on the alternatives), and to compar e and\\ncontrast the pros and cons of each approach.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern is effective in its generic\\nform and can be applied to a range of tasks effectively.\\nReﬁnements could include having a standardized catalog of\\nacceptable alternatives in a speciﬁc domain from which the\\nuser must select. The Alternative Approaches pattern can also\\nbe used to incentivize users to select one of an approved set\\nof approaches while informing them of the pros/cons of the\\napproved options.\\nH. The Cognitive Veriﬁer Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: Research literature has documented\\nthat LLMs can often reason better if a question is subdivided\\ninto additional questions that provide answers combined in to\\nthe overall answer to the original question [14]. The intent of\\nthe pattern is to force the LLM to always subdivide questionsinto additional questions that can be used to provide a bette r\\nanswer to the original question.\\n2) Motivation: The motivation of the Cognitive Veriﬁer\\npattern is two-fold:\\n•Humans may initially ask questions that are too high-\\nlevel to provide a concrete answer to without additional\\nfollow-up due to unfamiliarity with the domain, laziness\\nin prompt entry, or being unsure about what the correct\\nphrasing of the question should be.\\n•Research has demonstrated that LLMs can often perform\\nbetter when using a question that is subdivided into\\nindividual questions.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen you are asked a question, follow these rules\\nGenerate a number of additional questions that would\\nhelp more accurately answer the question\\nCombine the answers to the individual questions to\\nproduce the ﬁnal answer to the overall question\\nThe ﬁrst statement is to generate a number of additional\\nquestions that would help more accurately answer the origin al\\nquestion. This step instructs the LLM to consider the contex t\\nof the question and to identify any information that may be\\nmissing or unclear. By generating additional questions, th e\\nLLM can help to ensure that the ﬁnal answer is as complete\\nand accurate as possible. This step also encourages critica l\\nthinking by the user and can help to uncover new insights or\\napproaches that may not have been considered initially, whi ch\\nsubsequently lead to better follow-on questions.\\nThe second statement is to combine the answers to the\\nindividual questions to produce the ﬁnal answer to the overa ll\\nquestion. This step is designed to ensure that all of the info r-\\nmation gathered from the individual questions is incorpora ted\\ninto the ﬁnal answer. By combining the answers, the LLM\\ncan provide a more comprehensive and accurate response to\\nthe original question. This step also helps to ensure that al l\\nrelevant information is taken into account and that the ﬁnal\\nanswer is not based on any single answer.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“When I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. When I have answered the three\\nquestions, combine the answers to produce the ﬁnal\\nanswers to my original question.”\\nThis speciﬁc instance of the prompt pattern adds a reﬁne-\\nment to the original pattern by specifying a set number of\\nadditional questions that the LLM should generate in respon se\\nto a question. In this case, the prompt speciﬁes that ChatGPT\\nshould generate three additional questions that would help to\\ngive a more accurate answer to the original question. The\\nspeciﬁc number can be based on the user’s experience and\\nwillingness to provide follow-up information. A reﬁnement\\nto the prompt can be to provide a context for the amount', doc_id='07f87f46-ed71-45fc-8852-41d64e0cc702', embedding=None, doc_hash='690d8a77918edd0d281c36761c67f1d463728ddbd9419e3fbe5f703ccd3389cc', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='of knowledge that the LLM can assume the user has in the\\ndomain to guide the creation of the additional questions:\\n“When I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. Assume that I know little about\\nthe topic that we are discussing and please deﬁne\\nany terms that are not general knowledge. When\\nI have answered the three questions, combine the\\nanswers to produce the ﬁnal answers to my original\\nquestion.”\\nThe reﬁnement also speciﬁes that the user may not have\\na strong understanding of the topic being discussed, which\\nmeans that the LLM should deﬁne any terms that are not\\ngeneral knowledge. This helps to ensure that the follow-up\\nquestions are not only relevant and focused, but also access ible\\nto the user, who may not be familiar with technical or domain-\\nspeciﬁc terms. By providing clear and concise deﬁnitions, t he\\nLLM can help to ensure that the follow-up questions are easy\\nto understand and that the ﬁnal answer is accessible to users\\nwith varying levels of knowledge and expertise.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can dictate the exact number\\nof questions to generate or leave this decision to the LLM.\\nThere are pros and cons to dictating the exact number. A pro\\nis that specifying an exact number of questions can tightly\\nscope the amount of additional information the user is force d\\nto provide so it is within a range they are willing and able to\\ncontribute.\\nA con, however, is that given Nquestions there may be\\nan invaluable N+1question that will always be scoped out.\\nAlternatively, the LLM can be provided a range or allowed\\nto ask additional questions. Of course, by omitting a limit o n\\nthe number of questions the LLM may generate numerous\\nadditional questions that overwhelm the user.\\nI. The Fact Check List Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to ensure\\nthat the LLM outputs a list of facts that are present in the\\noutput and form an important part of the statements in the\\noutput. This list of facts helps inform the user of the facts\\n(or assumptions) the output is based on. The user can then\\nperform appropriate due diligence on these facts/assumpti ons\\nto validate the veracity of the output.\\n2) Motivation: A current weakness of LLMs (including\\nChatGPT) is they often rapidly (and even enthusiastically! )\\ngenerate convincing text that is factually incorrect. Thes e\\nerrors can take a wide range of forms, including fake statist ics\\nto invalid version numbers for software library dependenci es.\\nDue to the convincing nature of this generated text, however ,\\nusers may not perform appropriate due diligence to determin e\\nits accuracy.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nGenerate a set of facts that are contained in the output\\nThe set of facts should be inserted in a speciﬁc point\\nin the output\\nThe set of facts should be the fundamental facts that\\ncould undermine the veracity of the output if any of\\nthem are incorrect\\nOne point of variation in this pattern is where the facts are\\noutput. Given that the facts may be terms that the user is not\\nfamiliar with, it is preferable if the list of facts comes aft er\\nthe output. This after-output presentation ordering allow s the\\nuser to read and understand the statements before seeing wha t\\nstatements should be checked. The user may also determine\\nadditional facts prior to realizing the fact list at the end s hould\\nbe checked.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample wording of the Fact\\nCheck List pattern is shown below:\\n“From now on, when you generate an answer, create\\na set of facts that the answer depends on that should\\nbe fact-checked and list this set of facts at the\\nend of your output. Only include facts related to\\ncybersecurity.”\\nThe user may have expertise in some topics related to the\\nquestion but not others. The fact check list can be tailored t o\\ntopics that the user is not as experienced in or where there\\nis the most risk. For example, in the prompt above, the user\\nis scoping the fact check list to security topics, since thes e\\nare likely very important from a risk perspective and may not\\nbe well-understood by the developer. Targeting the facts al so\\nreduces the cognitive burden on the user by potentially list ing\\nfewer items for investigation.\\n5) Consequences: The Fact Check List pattern should be\\nemployed whenever users are not experts in the domain for\\nwhich they are generating output. For example, a software\\ndeveloper reviewing code could beneﬁt from the pattern\\nsuggesting security considerations. In contrast, an exper t on\\nsoftware architecture is likely to identify errors in state ments\\nabout the software structure and need not see a fact check lis t\\nfor these outputs.\\nErrors are potential in all LLM outputs, so Fact Check List\\nis an effective pattern to combine with other patterns, such\\nas by combining it with the Question Reﬁnement pattern. A\\nkey aspect of this pattern is that users can inherently check it\\nagainst the output. In particular, users can directly compa re the\\nfact check list to the output to verify the facts listed in the fact\\ncheck list actually appear in the output. Users can also iden tify\\nany omissions from the list. Although the fact check list may\\nalso have errors, users often have sufﬁcient knowledge and\\ncontext to determine its completeness and accuracy relativ e to\\nthe output.\\nOne caveat of the Fact Check List pattern is that it only\\napplies when the output type is amenable to fact-checking. F or\\nexample, the pattern works when asking ChatGPT to generate\\na Python “requirements.txt” ﬁle since it will list the versi ons\\nof libraries as facts that should be checked, which is handy a s', doc_id='203482c1-a3c8-44dd-a8bc-c473bd531b4a', embedding=None, doc_hash='edffd59f1d7b717b4e55a4ea660a04e4ab33866f807b264069b21a792a3e6f35', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='the versions commonly have errors. However, ChatGPT will\\nrefuse to generate a fact check list for a code sample and\\nindicate that this is something it cannot check, even though\\nthe code may have errors.\\nJ. The Template Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to\\nensure an LLM’s output follows a precise template in terms of\\nstructure. For example, the user might need to generate a URL\\nthat inserts generated information into speciﬁc positions within\\nthe URL path. This pattern allows the user to instruct the LLM\\nto produce its output in a format it would not ordinarily use\\nfor the speciﬁed type of content being generated.\\n2) Motivation: In some cases, output must be produced in\\na precise format that is application or use-case speciﬁc and\\nnot known to the LLM. Since the LLM is not aware of the\\ntemplate structure, it must be instructed on what the format\\nis and where the different parts of its output should go. This\\ncould take the form of a sample data structure that is being\\ngenerated, a series of form letters being ﬁlled in, etc.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI am going to provide a template for your output\\nX is my placeholder for content\\nTry to ﬁt the output into one or more of the placehold-\\ners that I list\\nPlease preserve the formatting and overall template that\\nI provide\\nThis is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLD-\\nERS\\nThe ﬁrst statement directs the LLM to follow a speciﬁc\\ntemplate for its output. The template will be used to try and\\ncoerce the LLMs responses into a structure that is consisten t\\nwith the user’s formatting needs. This pattern is needed whe n\\nthe target format is not known to the LLM. If the LLM already\\nhas knowledge of the format, such as a speciﬁc ﬁle type, then\\nthe template pattern can be skipped and the user can simply\\nspecify the known format. However, there may be cases, such\\nas generating Javascript Object Notation (JSON), where the re\\nis a large amount of variation in how the data could be\\nrepresented within that format and the template can be used t o\\nensure that the representation within the target format mee ts\\nthe user’s additional constraints.\\nThe second statement makes the LLM aware that the\\ntemplate will contain a set of placeholders. Users will expl ain\\nhow the output should be inserted into the template through t he\\nplaceholders. The placeholders allow the user to semantica lly\\ntarget where information should be inserted. Placeholders\\ncan use formats, like NAME, that allow the LLM to infer\\nthe semantic meaning of to determine where output should\\nbe inserted (e.g., insert the person’s name in the NAME\\nplaceholder). Moreover, by using placeholders, the user ca n\\nindicate what is not needed in the output – if a placeholder\\ndoesn’t exist for a component of the generated output, thenthat component can be omitted. Ideally, placeholders shoul d\\nuse a format that is commonly employed in text that the LLM\\nwas trained on, such as all caps, enclosure in brackets, etc.\\nThe third statement attempts to constrain the LLM so that it\\ndoesn’t arbitrarily rewrite the template or attempt to modi fy it\\nso that all of the output components can be inserted. It shoul d\\nbe noted that this statement may not preclude additional tex t\\nfrom being generated before or after. In practice, LLMs will\\ntypically follow the template, but it is harder to eliminate any\\nadditional text being generated beyond the template withou t\\nexperimentation with prompt wording.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample template for gener-\\nating URLs where the output is put into speciﬁc places in the\\ntemplate is shown below:\\n“I am going to provide a template for your out-\\nput. Everything in all caps is a placeholder. Any\\ntime that you generate text, try to ﬁt it into one\\nof the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the\\nformatting and overall template that I provide at\\nhttps://myapi.com/NAME/proﬁle/JOB”\\nA sample interaction after the prompt was provided, is\\nshown:\\nUser: “Generate a name and job title for a person”\\nChatGPT: “https://myapi.com/Emily Parker/proﬁle/\\nSoftware Engineer”\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of applying the Tem-\\nplate pattern is that it ﬁlters the LLM’s output, which may\\neliminate other outputs the LLM would have provided that\\nmight be useful to the user. In many cases, the LLM can\\nprovide helpful descriptions of code, decision making, or o ther\\ndetails that this pattern will effectively eliminate from t he\\noutput. Users should therefore weight the pros/cons of ﬁlte ring\\nout this additional information.\\nIn addition, ﬁltering can make it hard to combine this patter n\\nwith other patterns from the Output Customization category.\\nThe Template pattern effectively constrains the output format,\\nso it may not be compatible with generation of certain other\\ntypes of output. For example, in the template provided above\\nfor a URL, it would not be easy (or likely possible) to combine\\nwith the Recipe pattern, which needs to output a list of steps.\\nK. The Inﬁnite Generation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to\\nautomatically generate a series of outputs (which may appea r\\ninﬁnite) without having to reenter the generator prompt eac h\\ntime. The goal is to limit how much text the user must type to\\nproduce the next output, based on the assumption that the use r\\ndoes not want to continually reintroduce the prompt. In some\\nvariations, the intent is to allow the user to keep an initial\\nprompt template, but add additional variation to it through\\nadditional inputs prior to each generated output.\\n2) Motivation: Many tasks require repetitive application of\\nthe same prompt to multiple concepts. For example, generati ng\\ncode for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations\\nfor a speciﬁc type of entity may require applying the same', doc_id='2155b9f1-3459-4b91-a5f8-b832a41bfb77', embedding=None, doc_hash='4b53a2edfa56b6ffce1e1077c9366a40116997e0016819c17d8e5b01f10f8da8', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='prompt to multiple types of entities. If the user is forced to\\nretype the prompt over and over, they may make mistakes. The\\nInﬁnite Generation pattern allows the user to repetitively apply\\na prompt, either with or without further input, to automate\\nthe generation of multiple outputs using a predeﬁned set of\\nconstraints.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to generate output forever, X output(s)\\nat a time.\\n(Optional) here is how to use the input I provide\\nbetween outputs.\\n(Optional) stop when I ask you to.\\nThe ﬁrst statement speciﬁes that the user wants the LLM\\nto generate output indeﬁnitely, which effectively conveys the\\ninformation that the same prompt is going to be reused over\\nand over. By specifying the number of outputs that should be\\ngenerated at a time (i.e. “X outputs at a time”), the user can\\nrate limit the generation, which can be particularly import ant if\\nthere is a risk that the output will exceed the length limitat ions\\nof the LLM for a single output.\\nThe second statement provides optional instructions for ho w\\nto use the input provided by the user between outputs. By\\nspecifying how additional user inputs between prompts can\\nbe provided and leveraged, the user can create a prompting\\nstrategy that leverages user feedback in the context of the\\noriginal prompt. The original prompt is still in the context of\\nthe generation, but each user input between generation step s\\nis incorporated into the original prompt to reﬁne the output\\nusing prescribed rules.\\nThe third statement provides an optional way for the user\\nto stop the output generation process. This step is not alway s\\nneeded, but can be useful in situations where there may be\\nthe potential for ambiguity regarding whether or not the use r-\\nprovided input between inputs is meant as a reﬁnement for\\nthe next generation or a command to stop. For example, an\\nexplicit stop phrase could be created if the user was generat ing\\ndata related to road signs, where the user might want to enter\\na reﬁnement of the generation like “stop” to indicate that a\\nstop sign should be added to the output.\\n4) Example Implementation: The following is a sample\\ninﬁnite generation prompt for producing a series of URLs:\\n“From now on, I want you to generate a name\\nand job until I say stop. I am going to provide a\\ntemplate for your output. Everything in all caps is a\\nplaceholder. Any time that you generate text, try to\\nﬁt it into one of the placeholders that I list. Please\\npreserve the formatting and overall template that I\\nprovide: https://myapi.com/NAME/proﬁle/JOB”\\nThis prompt is combining the functionality of both the\\nInﬁnite Generation pattern and the Template pattern. The user\\nis requesting the LLM continuously generate a name and job\\ntitle until explicitly told to “stop”. The generated output s are\\nthen formatted into the template provided, which includesplaceholders for the name and job title. By using the Inﬁnite\\nGeneration pattern, the user receives multiple outputs without\\nhaving to continually re-enter the template. Likewise, the\\nTemplate pattern is applied to provide a consistent format for\\nthe outputs.\\n5) Consequences: In conversational LLMs, the input to\\nthe model at each time step is the previous output and the\\nnew user input. Although the details of what is preserved\\nand reintroduced in the next output cycle are model and\\nimplementation dependent, they are often limited in scope. The\\nmodel is therefore constantly being fed the previous output s\\nand the prompt, which can result in the model losing track of\\nthe original prompt instructions over time if they exceed th e\\nscope of what it is being provided as input.\\nAs additional outputs are generated, the context surroundi ng\\nthe prompt may fade, leading to the model deviating from\\nthe intended behavior. It is important to monitor the output s\\nproduced by the model to (1) ensure it still adheres to\\nthe desired behavior and (2) provide corrective feedback if\\nnecessary. Another issue to consider is that the LLM may\\ngenerate repetitive outputs, which may not be desired since\\nusers ﬁnd this repetition tedious and error-prone to proces s.\\nL. The Visualization Generator Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to use\\ntext generation to create visualizations. Many concepts ar e\\neasier to grasp in diagram or image format. The purpose of\\nthis pattern is to create a pathway for the tool to produce\\nimagery that is associated with other outputs. This pattern\\nallows the creation of visualizations by creating inputs fo r\\nother well-known visualization tools that use text as their\\ninput, such as Graphviz Dot [15] or DALL-E [13]. This\\npattern can provide a more comprehensive and effective way\\nof communicating information by combining the strengths of\\nboth the text generation and visualization tools.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs generally produce text and cannot\\nproduce imagery. For example, an LLM cannot draw a diagram\\nto describe a graph. The Visualization Generator pattern over-\\ncomes this limitation by generating textual inputs in the co rrect\\nformat to plug into another tool that generates the correct\\ndiagram. The motivation behind this pattern is to enhance th e\\noutput of the LLM and make it more visually appealing and\\neasier to understand for users. By using text inputs to gener ate\\nvisualizations, users can quickly understand complex conc epts\\nand relationships that may be hard to grasp through text alon e.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nGenerate an X that I can provide to tool Y to visualize\\nit\\nThe goal of the contextual statements is to indicate to the\\nLLM that the output it is going to produce, “X”, is going to\\nbe imagery. Since LLMs can’t generate images, the ”that I\\ncan provide to tool Y to visualize it” clariﬁes that the LLM\\nis not expected to generate an image, but is instead expected', doc_id='ba47ed59-e797-4588-8c50-23b8c77a3cbf', embedding=None, doc_hash='44669dbfc909636117540212c6112ee6e2b27795ec87f5424c3a300194b931b8', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='to produce a description of imagery consumable by tool Y for\\nproduction of the image.\\nMany tools may support multiple types of visualizations or\\nformats, and thus the target tool itself may not be sufﬁcient\\ninformation to accurately produce what the user wants. The\\nuser may need to state the precise types of visualizations (e .g.,\\nbar chart, directed graph, UML class diagram) that should be\\nproduced. For example, Graphviz Dot can create diagrams for\\nboth UML class diagrams and directed graphs. Further, as wil l\\nbe discussed in the following example, it can be advantageou s\\nto specify a list of possible tools and formats and let the LLM\\nselect the appropriate target for visualization.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“Whenever I ask you to visualize something, please\\ncreate either a Graphviz Dot ﬁle or DALL-E prompt\\nthat I can use to create the visualization. Choose\\nthe appropriate tools based on what needs to be\\nvisualized.”\\nThis example of the pattern adds a qualiﬁcation that the\\noutput type for the visualization can be either for Graphviz\\nor DALL-E. The interesting aspect of this approach is that\\nit allows the LLM to use its semantic understanding of the\\noutput format to automatically select the target tooling ba sed\\non what will be displayed. In this case, Graphviz would be for\\nvisualizing graphs with a need for an exactly deﬁned structu re.\\nDALL-E would be effective at visualizing realistic or artis tic\\nimagery that does not have an exactly deﬁned structure. The\\nLLM can select the tool based on the needs of the visualizatio n\\nand capabilities of each tool.\\n5) Consequences: The pattern creates a target pipeline\\nfor the output to render a visualization. The pipeline may\\ninclude AI generators, such as DALL-E, that can produce\\nrich visualizations. The pattern allows the user to expand t he\\nexpressive capabilities of the output into the visual domai n.\\nM. The Game Play Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to create\\na game around a given topic. The pattern can be combined\\nwith the Visualization Generator to add imagery to the game.\\nThe game is centered around a speciﬁc topic and the LLM\\nwill guide the game play. The pattern is particularly effect ive\\nwhen the rules of the game are relatively limited in scope, bu t\\nthe content for the game is expected to be wide in scope. The\\nuser can specify a limited set of rules and then the LLM can\\nautomate generation of bodies of content for game play.\\n2) Motivation: You would like the LLM to generate scenar-\\nios or questions revolving around a speciﬁc topic and requir e\\nusers to apply problem solving or other skills to accomplish\\na task related to the scenario. Generating all the content fo r\\nthe game manually would be too time consuming, however, so\\nyou would like the LLM to apply its knowledge of the topic\\nto guide the generation of content.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nCreate a game for me around X\\nOne or more fundamental rules of the game\\nThe ﬁrst statement, instructs the LLM to create a game and\\nprovides the important scoping of the game to a topic area. .\\nOne of the important capabilities of the pattern is that it al lows\\nthe user to create games by describing the rules of the game,\\nwithout having to determine the content of the game. The more\\nspeciﬁc the topic, typically the more novel and interesting the\\ngame play.\\nThe second statement introduces the rules of the game to the\\nLLM. It is important that the rules ﬁt within the capabilitie s\\nof the LLM. Textual games that rely on input and output text\\nsequences work best. One of the key attributes of the pattern\\nis that the input text can be rich and expressive, which can\\nlead to interesting interfaces for the game. For example, th e\\nuser might express actions in the game as scripts dictating\\na sequence of complex actions, such as “get a listing of all\\nnetwork activity and check it for anomalies”, which go beyon d\\nthe scope of multiple choice or short answer inputs. Each rul e\\nshould be provided as a separate statement regarding some\\naspect of the game.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample cybersecurity game\\nprompt is shown below:\\n“We are going to play a cybersecurity game. You\\nare going to pretend to be a Linux terminal for a\\ncomputer that has been compromised by an attacker.\\nWhen I type in a command, you are going to output\\nthe corresponding text that the Linux terminal would\\nproduce. I am going to use commands to try and\\nﬁgure out how the system was compromised. The\\nattack should have done one or more of the following\\nthings: (1) launched new processes, (2) changed\\nﬁles, (3) opened new ports to receive communi-\\ncation, (4) created new outbound connections, (5)\\nchanged passwords, (6) created new user accounts,\\nor (7) read and stolen information. To start the game,\\nprint a scenario of what happened that led to my\\ninvestigation and make the description have clues\\nthat I can use to get started.”\\nThis cybersecurity game prompt combines a number of pat-\\nterns, including Game Play andPersona . The Linux terminal\\npersona that is chosen for the game has been discussed in many\\nInternet posts [16]. This game further customizes the discu ssed\\nLinux persona to act as a Linux terminal of a computer\\ncompromised by a cyberattack. ChatGPT responds to Linux\\ncommands with appropriate terminal outputs and synthesize s\\na fake ﬁle system that has clues to a cyberattack.\\nSample output from this game with ChatGPT after typing\\nin “ls -alt”, the Linux command to generate a list of ﬁles in\\nthe current directory is shown below (permissions have been\\nremoved for formatting reasons):\\ntotal 56\\n5 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:31 .\\n1 user user 18881 Feb 16 14:31 .bash_history', doc_id='a2e85d25-1d4c-490a-ae20-53d5b085abc9', embedding=None, doc_hash='f842ded0d9694b4775ff727b042847756e8fb30ace24c6af83f0ecd53268c74c', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='43 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:30 ..\\n1 user user 1178 Aug 15 2022 .bashrc\\n1 user user 220 Aug 15 2022 .bash_logout\\n3 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:25 .gnupg\\n1 user user 4041 Feb 15 17:52 README.md\\n2 user user 4096 Feb 1 11:35 project\\nWhen the user then typed the command “cat .bash history”,\\nto display the contents of the log ﬁle showing the commands\\nrun by the user, ChatGPT responded with:\\ncd /var/www/html\\nsudo rm -rf *\\nsudo wget https://example.com/backdoor.php\\nsudo chmod 777 backdoor.php\\nexit\\nls -alt\\nps -ef\\nnetstat -tulnp\\nIn the output above, ChatGPT generated a fake log ﬁle with\\nrealistic commands for deleting the data being served by the\\nweb server in /var/www/html and replacing the content\\nwith a backdoor into the system.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can be combined effectively\\nwith the Persona ,Inﬁnite Generation , and Visualization Gen-\\nerator patterns. For example, the cybersecurity game uses the\\nPersona pattern so the LLM can masquerade as a Linux termi-\\nnal. For a network security game, the Visualization Generator\\ncould be employed to add the ability to visualize the network\\ntopology and trafﬁc ﬂows.\\nN. The Reﬂection Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask\\nthe model to automatically explain the rationale behind giv en\\nanswers to the user. The pattern allows users to better asses s\\nthe output’s validity, as well as inform users how an LLM\\narrived at a particular answer. Reﬂection can clarify any po ints\\nof confusion, uncover underlying assumptions, and reveal g aps\\nin knowledge or understanding.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs can and do make mistakes. More-\\nover, users may not understand why an LLM is producing\\na particular output and how to adapt their prompt to solve\\na problem with the output. By asking LLM to automatically\\nexplain the rationale behind its answers, users can gain a be tter\\nunderstanding of how the model is processing the input, what\\nassumptions it is making, and what data it is drawing on.\\nLLMs may sometime provide incomplete, incorrect, or\\nambiguous answers. Reﬂection is an aid to help address these\\nshortcomings and ensure the information provided by LLM\\nis as accurate. A further beneﬁt of the pattern is that it can\\nhelp users debug their prompts and determine why they are\\nnot getting results that meet expectations. This pattern is\\nparticularly effective for the exploration of topics that c an\\nbe confused with other topics or that may have nuanced\\ninterpretations and where knowing the precise interpretat ion\\nthat the LLM used is important.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you generate an answer\\nExplain the reasoning and assumptions behind your\\nanswer\\n(Optional) ...so that I can improve my question\\nThe ﬁrst statement is requesting that, after generating an a n-\\nswer, the LLM should explain the reasoning and assumptions\\nbehind the answer. This statement helps the user understand\\nhow the LLM arrived at the answer and can help build trust in\\nthe model’s responses. The prompt includes the statement th at\\nthe purpose of the explanation is for the user to reﬁne their\\nquestion. This additional statement gives the LLM the conte xt\\nit needs to better tailor its explanations to the speciﬁc pur pose\\nof aising the user in producing follow-on questions.\\n4) Example Implementation: This example tailors the\\nprompt speciﬁcally to the domain of providing answers relat ed\\nto code:\\n”When you provide an answer, please explain the\\nreasoning and assumptions behind your selection\\nof software frameworks. If possible, use speciﬁc\\nexamples or evidence with associated code samples\\nto support your answer of why the framework is\\nthe best selection for the task. Moreover, please\\naddress any potential ambiguities or limitations in\\nyour answer, in order to provide a more complete\\nand accurate response.”\\nThe pattern is further customized to instruct the LLM that\\nit should justify its selection of software frameworks, but not\\nnecessarily other aspects of the answer. In addition, the us er\\ndictates that code samples should be used to help explain the\\nmotivation for selecting the speciﬁc software framework.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the Reﬂection pat-\\ntern is that it may not be effective for users who do not\\nunderstand the topic area of the discussion. For example, a\\nhighly technical question by a non-technical user may resul t\\nin a complex rationale for the answer that the user cannot\\nfathom. As with other prompt patterns, there is a risk the\\noutput may include errors or inaccurate assumptions includ ed\\nin the explanation of the rationale that the user may not be\\nable to spot. This pattern can be combined with the Fact Check\\nListto help address this issue.\\nO. The Refusal Breaker Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask an\\nLLM to automatically help users rephrase a question when it\\nrefuses to give an answer. This pattern has the potential for\\nmisuse, however, e.g., to generate phishing emails or perform\\nother actions that violate LLM policy ﬁlters. Caution shoul d\\ntherefore be exercised when applying this pattern to ensure\\nit is used ethically and responsibly. This pattern has been\\nused successfully in some LLMs to overcome the underlying\\nprompts used to program the LLM and prevent harmful output\\ngeneration.', doc_id='9ceb233f-db44-4b81-a9cc-51032ee15eb1', embedding=None, doc_hash='b29bfe378509c7bc32514d27be13c92033ec4bec301c87fbaf408b98cd0546ee', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='2) Motivation: LLMs may sometimes refuse to answer\\na question, either because they do not have the required\\nknowledge or because the question is phrased in a way that\\nthey do not understand. This outcome may be frustrating\\nfor users who are looking for answers. In some situations,\\ntherefore, the Refusal Breaker pattern can help users ﬁnd a\\nway to either rephrase their question or ask a different ques tion\\nthe LLM is better equipped to answer.\\nFor example, you could ask for clariﬁcation on why the\\nquestion was refused, as there may be a speciﬁc reason why\\nLLM could not provide an answer. Another approach is to\\nask a different question that may be within its knowledge cut -\\noff or expertise. However, all these approaches require use r\\nintervention and knowledge of how to bypass the refusal.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you can’t answer a question\\nExplain why you can’t answer the question\\nProvide one or more alternative wordings of the ques-\\ntion that you could answer\\nThe ﬁrst statement sets the stage that this set of instructio ns\\nshould only be applied when a question can’t be answered.\\nThe user does not want to trigger these instructions under\\nnormal circumstances. The second statement instructs the\\nLLM to provide an explanation of why the question can’t be\\nanswered. The explanation is likely to include assumptions ,\\nconstraints, or misunderstandings that can be leveraged by the\\nuser to strategize about how to reword the question. Althoug h\\njust the explanation of why the question can’t be answered\\ncould help a user overcome the refusal, the pattern adds an\\nadditional statement for the LLM to suggest rewordings that\\nwould be acceptable. The pattern combines both reasoning\\nand suggested rewordings to improve the chances that the use r\\nwill ﬁnd a path around whatever roadblocks are preventing th e\\nquestion form being answered.\\n4) Example Implementation: The Refusal Breaker pattern\\ncan be be implemented and applied with the following phras-\\ning:\\n“Whenever you can’t answer a question, explain why\\nand provide one or more alternate wordings of the\\nquestion that you can’t answer so that I can improve\\nmy questions.”\\nA sample discourse after using the pattern is shown below:\\nUser: What is the meaning of life?\\nChatGPT : As an AI language model, I do not\\nhave personal beliefs or opinions. The meaning of\\nlife is a complex philosophical question that has\\nbeen pondered by humans for centuries and can\\nvary greatly from person to person. It may be more\\nproductive to rephrase the question in a way that can\\nbe answered by information and knowledge, such\\nas “What are some philosophical perspectives onthe meaning of life?” or “What are some common\\nbeliefs about the purpose of life?”\\n5) Consequences: This pattern provides a potential path\\nfor misuse, so organizations, parents, or other stakeholde rs\\nmay need to restrict the usage of the LLM. The ﬁrst step in\\ngoing around guardrails on usage is to understand where the\\nguardrails are. In future work, a complement of this pattern\\nmay be developed to hide the underlying prompt information\\nand rationale from users to prevent discovery.\\nAlthough the rationale and alternate rewordings are gener-\\nated, there is no guarantee that users will be able to overcom e\\nthe refusal. The alternate questions that are generated may not\\nbe of interest to the user or helpful in answering the origina l\\nquestion. The pattern mainly provides an aid in determining\\nwhat the LLM can answer, but not a guarantee that it will\\nanswer a semantically equivalent variation of the original\\nquestion.\\nP . The Context Manager Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to enable\\nusers to specify or remove context for a conversation with\\nan LLM. The goal is to focus the conversation on speciﬁc\\ntopics or exclude unrelated topics from consideration. Thi s\\npattern gives users greater control over what statements th e\\nLLM considers or ignores when generating output.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs often struggle to interpret the in-\\ntended context of the current question or generate irreleva nt\\nresponses based on prior inputs or irrelevant attention on\\nthe wrong statements. By focusing on explicit contextual\\nstatements or removing irrelevant statements, users can he lp\\nthe LLM better understand the question and generate more\\naccurate responses. Users may introduce unrelated topics o r\\nreference information from earlier in the dialogue, which\\nmay can disrupt the ﬂow of the conversation. The Context\\nManager pattern aims to emphasize or remove speciﬁc aspects\\nof the context to maintain relevance and coherence in the\\nconversation.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X\\nPlease consider Y\\nPlease ignore Z\\n(Optional) start over\\nStatements about what to consider or ignore should list key\\nconcepts, facts, instructions, etc. that should be include d or\\nremoved from the context. The more explicit the statements\\nare, the more likely the LLM will take appropriate action. Fo r\\nexample, if the user asks to ignore subjects related to a topi c,\\nyet some of the those statements were discussed far back in th e\\nconversation, the LLM may not properly disregard the releva nt\\ninformation. The more explicit the list is, therefore, the b etter\\nthe inclusion/exclusion behavior will be.', doc_id='721e98ad-005e-40f8-b46e-b6b333507e67', embedding=None, doc_hash='6d039a497c167c2228e23dcf8a69dc6be479c221e9a86d91e576be571ec82257', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='4) Example Implementation: To specify context consider\\nusing the following prompt:\\n“When analyzing the following pieces of code, only\\nconsider security aspects.”\\nLikewise, to remove context consider using the following\\nprompt:\\n“When analyzing the following pieces of code, do\\nnot consider formatting or naming conventions.”\\nClarity and speciﬁcity are important when providing or\\nremoving context to/from an LLM so it can better understand\\nthe intended scope of the conversation and generate more\\nrelevant responses. In many situations, the user may want to\\ncompletely start over and can employ this prompt to reset the\\nLLM’s context:\\n“Ignore everything that we have discussed. Start\\nover.”\\nThe “start over” idea helps produce a complete reset of the\\ncontext.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of this pattern is that\\nit may inadvertently wipe out patterns applied to the con-\\nversation that the user is unaware of. For example, if an\\norganization injects a series of helpful patterns into the s tart of\\na conversation, the user may not be aware of these patterns an d\\nremove them through a reset of the context. This reset could\\npotentially eliminate helpful capabilities of the LLM, whi le\\nnot making it obvious that the user will lose this functional ity.\\nA potential solution to this problem is to include in the prom pt\\na request to explain what topics/instructions will potenti ally be\\nlost before proceeding.\\nQ. The Recipe Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern provides constraints to\\nultimately output a sequence of steps given some partially\\nprovided “ingredients” that must be conﬁgured in a sequence\\nof steps to achieve a stated goal. It combines the Template ,\\nAlternative Approaches , and Reﬂection patterns.\\n2) Motivation: Users often want an LLM to analyze a\\nconcrete sequence of steps or procedures to achieve a stated\\noutcome. Typically, users generally know—or have an idea\\nof—what the end goal should look like and what “ingredients”\\nbelong in the prompt. However, they may not necessarily know\\nthe precise ordering of steps to achieve that end goal.\\nFor example, a user may want a precise speciﬁcation on how\\na piece of code should be implemented or automated, such as\\n“create an Ansible playbook to ssh into a set of servers, copy\\ntext ﬁles from each server, spawn a monitoring process on\\neach server, and then close the ssh connection to each server .\\nIn other words, this pattern represents a generalization of the\\nexample of “given the ingredients in my fridge, provide dinn er\\nrecipes.” A user may also want to specify a set number of\\nalternative possibilities, such as “provide 3 different wa ys of\\ndeploying a web application to AWS using Docker containers\\nand Ansible using step by step instructions”.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like to achieve X\\nI know that I need to perform steps A,B,C\\nProvide a complete sequence of steps for me\\nFill in any missing steps\\nIdentify any unnecessary steps\\nThe ﬁrst statement “I would like to achieve X” focuses the\\nLLM on the overall goal that the recipe needs to be built\\nto achieve. The steps will be organized and completed to\\nsequentially achieve the goal speciﬁed. The second stateme nt\\nprovides the partial list of steps that the user would like\\nto include in the overall recipe. These serve as intermediat e\\nwaypoints for the path that the LLM is going to generate or\\nconstraints on the structure of the recipe. The next stateme nt\\nin the pattern, “provide a complete sequence of steps for\\nme”, indicates to the LLM that the goal is to provide a\\ncomplete sequential ordering of steps. The “ﬁll in any missi ng\\nsteps” helps ensure that the LLM will attempt to complete\\nthe recipe without further follow-up by making some choices\\non the user’s behalf regarding missing steps, as opposed to\\njust stating additional information that is needed. Finall y, the\\nlast statement, “identify any unnecessary steps,” is usefu l in\\nﬂagging inaccuracies in the user’s original request so that the\\nﬁnal recipe is efﬁcient.\\n4) Example Implementation: An example usage of this\\npattern in the context of deploying a software application t o\\nthe cloud is shown below:\\n“I am trying to deploy an application to the cloud. I\\nknow that I need to install the necessary dependen-\\ncies on a virtual machine for my application. I know\\nthat I need to sign up for an AWS account. Please\\nprovide a complete sequence of steps. Please ﬁll in\\nany missing steps. Please identify any unnecessary\\nsteps.”\\nDepending on the use case and constraints, “installing\\nnecessary dependencies on a virtual machine” may be an\\nunnecessary step. For example, if the application is alread y\\npackaged in a Docker container, the container could be de-\\nployed directly to the AWS Fargate Service, which does not\\nrequire any management of the underlying virtual machines.\\nThe inclusion of the “identify unnecessary steps” language\\nwill cause the LLM to ﬂag this issue and omit the steps from\\nthe ﬁnal recipe.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the recipe pattern is\\nthat a user may not always have a well-speciﬁed description\\nof what they would like to implement, construct, or design.\\nMoreover, this pattern may introduce unwanted bias from the\\nuser’s initially selected steps so the LLM may try to ﬁnd a\\nsolution that incorporates them, rather than ﬂagging them a s\\nunneeded. For example, an LLM may try to ﬁnd a solution\\nthat does install dependencies for a virtual machine, even i f\\nthere are solutions that do not require that.', doc_id='e4b5366d-e620-4463-a145-f1cf68f293fb', embedding=None, doc_hash='3dd729c817e39f9f42ff55f83152f09ddf9f8c4210e78c49fc147faf34343372', extra_info={'nome file': 'Chain of thoughts.pdf'}), Document(text='IV. R ELATED WORK\\nSoftware patterns [10], [11] have been extensively studied\\nand documented in prior work. Patterns are widely used in\\nsoftware engineering to express the intent of design struct ures\\nin a way that is independent of implementation details. Patt erns\\nprovide a mental picture of the goals that the pattern is\\ntrying to achieve and the forces that it is trying to resolve.\\nA key advantage of patterns is their composability, allowin g\\ndevelopers to build pattern sequences and pattern language s\\nthat can be used to address complex problems. Patterns have\\nalso been investigated in other domains, such as contract\\ndesign for decentralized ledgers [17], [18].\\nThe importance of good prompt design with LLMs, such as\\nChatGPT, is well understood [19]–[28]. Previous studies ha ve\\nexamined the effect of prompt words on AI generative models.\\nFor example, Liu et al. [29] investigated how different\\nprompt key words affect image generation and different char -\\nacteristics of images. Other work has explored using LLMs\\nto generate visualizations [30]. Han et al. [31] researched\\nstrategies for designing prompts for classiﬁcation tasks. Other\\nresearch has looked at boolean prompt design for literature\\nqueries [32]. Yet other work has speciﬁcally examined promp ts\\nfor software and ﬁxing bugs [33].\\nOur work is complementary to prior work by providing\\na structure for documenting, discussing, and reasoning abo ut\\nprompts that can aid users in developing mental models for\\nstructuring prompts to solve common problems.\\nThe quality of the answers produced by LLMs, particuarly\\nChatGPT, has been assessed in a number of domains. For\\nexample, ChatGPT has been used to take the medical licensing\\nexam with surprisingly good results [3]. The use of ChatGPT\\nin Law School has also been explored [34]. Other papers have\\nlooked at its mathematical reasoning abilities [35]. As mor e\\ndomains are explored, we expect that domain-speciﬁc patter n\\ncatalogs will be developed to share domain-speciﬁc problem\\nsolving prompt structures.\\nV. C ONCLUDING REMARKS\\nThis paper presented a framework for documenting and\\napplying a catalog of prompt patterns for large language\\nmodels (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. These prompt patterns are\\nanalogous to software patterns and aim to provide reusable\\nsolutions to problems that users face when interacting with\\nLLMs to perform a wide range of tasks. The catalog of prompt\\npatterns captured via this framework (1) provides a structu red\\nway of discussing prompting solutions, (2) identiﬁes patte rns\\nin prompts, rather than focusing on speciﬁc prompt examples ,\\nand (3) classiﬁes patterns so users are guided to more efﬁcie nt\\nand effective interactions with LLMs.\\nThe following lessons learned were gleaned from our work\\non prompt patterns:\\n•Prompt patterns signiﬁcantly enrich the capabilities that\\ncan be created in a conversational LLM . For example,\\nprompts can lead to the generation of cybersecurity\\ngames, complete with ﬁctitious terminal commands thathave been run by an attacker stored in a .bashhistory\\nﬁle. As shown in Section III, larger and more complex\\ncapabilities can be created by combining prompt patterns,\\nsuch as combining the Game Play and Visualization\\nGenerator patterns.\\n•Documenting prompt patterns as a pattern catalog is\\nuseful, but insufﬁcient . Our experience indicates that\\nmuch more work can be done in this area, both in terms\\nof reﬁning and expanding the prompt patterns presented\\nin this paper, as well as in exploring new and innovative\\nways of using LLMs. In particular, weaving the prompt\\npatterns captured here as a pattern catalog into a more\\nexpression pattern language will help guide users of\\nLLMs more effectively.\\n•LLM Capabilities will evolve over time, likely necessitat-\\ning reﬁnement of patterns. As LLM capabilities change,\\nsome patterns may no longer be necessary, be obviated\\nby different styles of interaction or conversation/sessio n\\nmanagement approaches, or require enhancement to func-\\ntion correctly. Continued work will be needed to docu-\\nment and catalog patterns that provide reusable solutions.\\n•The prompt patterns are generalizable to many differ-\\nent domains. Although most of the patterns have been\\ndiscussed in the context of software development, these\\nsame patterns are applicable in arbitrary domains, ranging\\nfrom inﬁnite generation of stories for entertainment to\\neducational games to explorations of topics.\\nWe hope that this paper inspires further research and de-\\nvelopment in this area that will help enhance prompt pattern\\ndesign to create new and unexpected capabilities for conver -\\nsational LLMs.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] R.

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge\\nnaturally in sufﬁciently large language models via a simple method called chain-of-\\nthought prompting , where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as\\nexemplars in prompting.\\nExperiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting\\nimproves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic\\nreasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a\\nPaLM 540B with just eight chain-of-thought exemplars achieves state-of-the-art\\naccuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even\\nﬁnetuned GPT-3 with a veriﬁer.\\nA: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally.

(2021).The NLP landscape has recently been revolutionized by\\nlanguage models (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019;\\nBrown et al., 2020, inter alia ). Scaling up the size of lan-\\nguage models has been shown to confer a range of beneﬁts,\\nsuch as improved performance and sample efﬁciency (Ka-\\nplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020, inter alia ). However,\\nscaling up model size alone has not proved sufﬁcient for\\nachieving high performance on challenging tasks such as\\narithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Rae\\net al., 2021).\\nThis work explores how the reasoning ability of large\\nlanguage models can be unlocked by a simple method\\nmotivated by two ideas. First, techniques for arithmetic\\nreasoning can beneﬁt from generating natural language\\nrationales that lead to the ﬁnal answer. Prior work has\\ngiven models the ability to generate natural language inter-\\nmediate steps by training from scratch (Ling et al., 2017)\\nor ﬁnetuning a pretrained model (Cobbe et al., 2021), in\\naddition to neuro-symbolic methods that use formal lan-\\nguages instead of natural language (Roy and Roth, 2015;\\nChiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al.,\\n2019). Second, large language models offer the exciting\\nprospect of in-context few-shot learning via prompting . That is, instead of ﬁnetuning a separate\\nlanguage model checkpoint for each new task, one can simply “prompt” the model with a few\\ninput–output exemplars demonstrating the task. Remarkably, this has been successful for a range of\\nsimple question-answering tasks (Brown et al., 2020).\\nBoth of the above ideas, however, have key limitations. For rationale-augmented training and\\nﬁnetuning methods, it is costly to create a large set of high quality rationales, which is much more\\ncomplicated than simple input–output pairs used in normal machine learning. For the traditional few-\\nshot prompting method used in Brown et al. (2020), it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning\\nabilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale (Rae et al.,\\n2021). In this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning\\ntasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: hinput, chain of thought , outputi. Achain of thought is\\na series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal output, and we refer to\\nthis approach as chain-of-thought prompting . An example prompt is shown in Figure 1.\\nWe present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks,\\nshowing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking\\ndegree. Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems\\n(Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting\\nby a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. A prompting only approach is\\nimportant because it does not require a large training dataset and because a single model checkpoint\\ncan perform many tasks without loss of generality. This work underscores how large language models\\ncan learn via a few examples with natural language data about the task (c.f. automatically learning\\nthe patterns underlying inputs and outputs via a large training dataset).\\n2 Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nConsider one’s own thought process when solving a complicated reasoning task such as a multi-step\\nmath word problem. It is typical to decompose the problem into intermediate steps and solve each\\nbefore giving the ﬁnal answer: “After Jane gives 2 ﬂowers to her mom she has 10 :::then after she\\ngives 3 to her dad she will have 7 :::so the answer is 7. ” The goal of this paper is to endow language\\nmodels with the ability to generate a similar chain of thought —a coherent series of intermediate\\nreasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal answer for a problem. We will show that sufﬁciently large\\n2', doc_id='ca490f13-27c8-4f1c-832e-114a4edda0fa', embedding=None, doc_hash='7778451b1e7bb41b6be219026f9529d567f51a4f81704de4bd5b45b840d5cf5c', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='language models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the ﬁnal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model’s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in sufﬁciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁnetuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following ﬁve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input–output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting—Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20. (These particular exemplars did not undergo\\nprompt engineering; robustness is studied in Section 3.4 and Appendix A.2.)

For AQuA, we used four exemplars\\nand solutions from the training set, as given in Appendix Table 21.\\nLanguage models. We evaluate ﬁve large language models. The ﬁrst is GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\\n2020), for which we use text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, and text-davinci-002, which\\npresumably correspond to InstructGPT models of 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B parameters (Ouyang\\net al., 2022).The second is LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), which has models of 422M, 2B, 8B,\\n68B, and 137B parameters. The third is PaLM , which has models of 8B, 62B, and 540B parameters.\\nThe fourth is UL2 20B (Tay et al., 2022), and the ﬁfth is Codex (Chen et al., 2021, code-davinci-002\\nin the OpenAI API). We sample from the models via greedy decoding (though follow-up work shows\\nchain-of-thought prompting can be improved by taking the majority ﬁnal answer over many sampled\\ngenerations (Wang et al., 2022a)). For LaMDA, we report averaged results over ﬁve random seeds,\\nwhere each seed had a different randomly shufﬂed order of exemplars. As LaMDA experiments\\ndid not show large variance among different seeds, to save compute we report results for a single\\nexemplar order for all other models.\\n3.2 Results\\nThe strongest results of chain-of-thought prompting are summarized in Figure 4, with all experimental\\noutputs for each model collection, model size, and benchmark shown in Table 2 in the Appendix.\\nThere are three key takeaways. First, Figure 4 shows that chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent\\nability of model scale (Wei et al., 2022b). That is, chain-of-thought prompting does not positively\\nimpact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of\\n\\x18100B parameters. We qualitatively found that models of smaller scale produced ﬂuent but illogical\\nchains of thought, leading to lower performance than standard prompting.\\n4', doc_id='bde2d043-86cf-4000-a8f2-6899bcaa6afd', embedding=None, doc_hash='3fd24529a0e6dbf3f3ac5569ca2c9409ca08a46fcca48aed614ef43d9fc8c904', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='0204060GSM8K\\nsolve rate (%)LaMDA GPT PaLMStandard prompting\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nPrior supervised best\\n020406080SV AMP\\nsolve rate (%)\\n0.4 81370255075100MAWPS\\nsolve rate (%)\\n0.4 7175 862540\\nModel scale (# parameters in billions)\\nFigure 4: Chain-of-thought prompting enables\\nlarge language models to solve challenging math\\nproblems. Notably, chain-of-thought reasoning\\nis an emergent ability of increasing model scale.\\nPrior best numbers are from Cobbe et al. (2021)\\nfor GSM8K, Jie et al. (2022) for SV AMP, and Lan\\net al. (2021) for MAWPS.Second, chain-of-thought prompting has larger\\nperformance gains for more-complicated prob-\\nlems. For instance, for GSM8K (the dataset\\nwith the lowest baseline performance), perfor-\\nmance more than doubled for the largest GPT\\nand PaLM models. On the other hand, for Sin-\\ngleOp, the easiest subset of MAWPS which only\\nrequires a single step to solve, performance im-\\nprovements were either negative or very small\\n(see Appendix Table 3).\\nThird, chain-of-thought prompting via GPT-3\\n175B and PaLM 540B compares favorably to\\nprior state of the art, which typically ﬁnetunes a\\ntask-speciﬁc model on a labeled training dataset.\\nFigure 4 shows how PaLM 540B uses chain-of-\\nthought prompting to achieve new state of the art\\non GSM8K, SV AMP, and MAWPS (though note\\nthat standard prompting already passed the prior\\nbest for SV AMP). On the other two datasets,\\nAQuA and ASDiv, PaLM with chain-of-thought\\nprompting reaches within 2% of the state of the\\nart (Appendix Table 2).\\nTo better understand why chain-of-thought\\nprompting works, we manually examined model-\\ngenerated chains of thought by LaMDA 137B\\nfor GSM8K. Of 50 random examples where the\\nmodel returned the correct ﬁnal answer, all of\\nthe generated chains of thought were also log-\\nically and mathematically correct except two\\nthat coincidentally arrived at the correct answer\\n(see Appendix D.1, and Table 8 for examples\\nof correct model-generated chains of thought).\\nWe also randomly examined 50 random sam-\\nples for which the model gave the wrong answer.\\nThe summary of this analysis is that 46% of the\\nchains of thought were almost correct, barring\\nminor mistakes (calculator error, symbol map-\\nping error, or one reasoning step missing), and that the other 54% of the chains of thought had major\\nerrors in semantic understanding or coherence (see Appendix D.2). To provide a small insight into\\nwhy scaling improves chain-of-thought reasoning ability, we performed a similar analysis of errors\\nmade by PaLM 62B and whether those errors were ﬁxed by scaling to PaLM 540B. The summary\\nis that scaling PaLM to 540B ﬁxes a large portion of one-step missing and semantic understanding\\nerrors in the 62B model (see Appendix A.1).\\n3.3 Ablation Study\\nThe observed beneﬁts of using chain-of-thought prompting raises the natural question of whether the\\nsame performance improvements can be conferred via other types of prompting. Figure 5 shows an\\nablation study with three variations of chain of thought described below.\\nEquation only. One reason for why chain-of-thought prompting might help is that it produces the\\nmathematical equation to be evaluated, and so we test a variation where the model is prompted\\nto output only a mathematical equation before giving the answer. Figure 5 shows that equation\\nonly prompting does not help much for GSM8K, which implies that the semantics of the questions\\nin GSM8K are too challenging to directly translate into an equation without the natural language\\nreasoning steps in chain of thought. For datasets of one-step or two-step problems, however, we ﬁnd\\nthat equation only prompting does improve performance, since the equation can be easily derived\\nfrom the question (see Appendix Table 6).\\n5', doc_id='acac41dd-04ed-4354-8075-1cd91ccde7fc', embedding=None, doc_hash='a2549f9f47aaab9eced4a87a3096cfc0a738c72e45d0073994579daef6b19883', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='LaMDA PaLM0204060GSM8K solve rate (%)Standard prompting\\nEquation only\\nVariable compute only\\nReasoning after answer\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nFigure 5: Ablation study for dif-\\nferent variations of prompting us-\\ning LaMDA 137B and PaLM 540B.\\nResults for other datasets are given\\nin Appendix Table 6 and Table 7.Variable compute only. Another intuition is that chain of\\nthought allows the model to spend more computation (i.e.,\\nintermediate tokens) on harder problems. To isolate the effect\\nof variable computation from chain-of-thought reasoning, we\\ntest a conﬁguration where the model is prompted to output a\\nonly sequence of dots ( :::) equal to the number of characters in\\nthe equation needed to solve the problem. This variant performs\\nabout the same as the baseline, which suggests that variable\\ncomputation by itself is not the reason for the success of chain-\\nof-thought prompting, and that there appears to be utility from\\nexpressing intermediate steps via natural language.\\nChain of thought after answer. Another potential beneﬁt of\\nchain-of-thought prompting could simply be that such prompts\\nallow the model to better access relevant knowledge acquired\\nduring pretraining. Therefore, we test an alternative conﬁgura-\\ntion where the chain of thought prompt is only given after the\\nanswer, isolating whether the model actually depends on the\\nproduced chain of thought to give the ﬁnal answer. This variant\\nperforms about the same as the baseline, which suggests that\\nthe sequential reasoning embodied in the chain of thought is\\nuseful for reasons beyond just activating knowledge.\\n3.4 Robustness of Chain of Thought\\nGSM8K05101520Solve rate (%)Standard prompting\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\n\\x01different annotator (B)\\n\\x01different annotator (C)\\n\\x01intentionally concise style\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\x0b)\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\x0c)\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\r)\\nMAWPS0204060\\nFigure 6: Chain-of-thought prompting\\nhas variance for different prompt exam-\\nples (as expected) but outperforms stan-\\ndard prompting for various annotators as\\nwell as for different exemplars.Sensitivity to exemplars is a key consideration of prompt-\\ning approaches—for instance, varying the permutation of\\nfew-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy of GPT-3 on\\nSST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near state of\\nthe art (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021). In this ﬁnal subsec-\\ntion, we evaluate robustness to chains of thought written\\nby different annotators. In addition to the results above,\\nwhich used chains of thought written by an Annotator\\nA, two other co-authors of this paper (Annotators B and\\nC) independently wrote chains of thought for the same\\nfew-shot exemplars (shown in Appendix H). Annotator A\\nalso wrote another chain of thought that was more concise\\nthan the original, following the style of solutions given in\\nCobbe et al. (2021).1\\nFigure 6 shows these results for LaMDA 137B on GSM8K\\nand MAWPS (ablation results for other datasets are given\\nin Appendix Table 6 / Table 7). Although there is variance\\namong different chain of thought annotations, as would be\\nexpected when using exemplar-based prompting (Le Scao\\nand Rush, 2021; Reynolds and McDonell, 2021; Zhao\\net al., 2021), all sets of chain of thought prompts outper-\\nform the standard baseline by a large margin. This result\\nimplies that successful use of chain of thought does not\\ndepend on a particular linguistic style.\\nTo conﬁrm that successful chain-of-thought prompting\\nworks for other sets of exemplars, we also run experiments\\nwith three sets of eight exemplars randomly sampled from the GSM8K training set, an independent\\n1For instance, whereas original chain of thought uses several short sentences ( “’There were originally 9\\ncomputers.

So there are 9 + 20 = 29\\nnew computers in the server room now” .\\n6', doc_id='c5ecb654-1e88-4a61-8cb9-c165072354c6', embedding=None, doc_hash='05d0f93532d723720f5e935824226a826cb881239ae1f87572295282b155ed2a', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='source (examples in this dataset already included reasoning steps like a chain of thought).2Fig-\\nure 6 shows that these prompts performed comparably with our manually written exemplars, also\\nsubstantially outperforming standard prompting.\\nIn addition to robustness to annotators, independently-written chains of thought, different exemplars,\\nand various language models, we also ﬁnd that chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic reasoning\\nis robust to different exemplar orders and varying numbers of exemplars (see Appendix A.2).\\n4 Commonsense Reasoning\\nAlthough chain of thought is particularly suitable for math word problems, the language-based nature\\nof chain of thought actually makes it applicable to a broad class of commonsense reasoning problems,\\nwhich involve reasoning about physical and human interactions under the presumption of general\\nbackground knowledge.

We consider ﬁve datasets covering a diverse range of commonsense reasoning types.\\nThe popular CSQA (Talmor et al., 2019) asks commonsense questions about the world involving\\ncomplex semantics that often require prior knowledge. StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) requires\\nmodels to infer a multi-hop strategy to answer questions. We choose two specialized evaluation sets\\nfrom the BIG-bench effort (BIG-bench collaboration, 2021): Date Understanding, which involves\\ninferring a date from a given context, and Sports Understanding, which involves determining whether\\na sentence relating to sports is plausible or implausible. Finally, the SayCan dataset (Ahn et al.,\\n2022) involves mapping a natural language instruction to a sequence of robot actions from a discrete\\nset.

For CSQA and StrategyQA,\\nwe randomly selected examples from the training set and manually composed chains of thought for\\nthem to use as few-shot exemplars. The two BIG-bench tasks do not have training sets, so we selected\\nthe ﬁrst ten examples as exemplars in the evaluation set as few-shot exemplars and report numbers on\\nthe rest of the evaluation set. For SayCan, we use six examples from the training set used in Ahn et al.\\n(2022) and also manually composed chains of thought.\\nResults. Figure 7 highlights these results for PaLM (full results for LaMDA, GPT-3, and different\\nmodel scales are shown in Table 4). For all tasks, scaling up model size improved the performance\\nof standard prompting; chain-of-thought prompting led to further gains, with improvements appear-\\ning to be largest for PaLM 540B.

We show that chain-of-\\nthought prompting not only enables language models to\\nperform symbolic reasoning tasks that are challenging in\\nthe standard prompting setting, but also facilitates length\\ngeneralization to inference-time inputs longer than those\\nseen in the few-shot exemplars.\\nTasks. We use the following two toy tasks.\\n•Last letter concatenation. This task asks the model\\nto concatenate the last letters of words in a name (e.g.,\\n“Amy Brown”!“yn” ). It is a more challenging version\\nof ﬁrst letter concatenation, which language models can\\nalready perform without chain of thought.3We generate\\nfull names by randomly concatenating names from the\\ntop one-thousand ﬁrst and last names from name census\\ndata ( https://namecensus.com/ ).\\n•Coin ﬂip. This task asks the model to answer whether a\\ncoin is still heads up after people either ﬂip or don’t ﬂip\\nthe coin (e.g., “A coin is heads up. Phoebe ﬂips the coin.\\nOsvaldo does not ﬂip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?”\\n!“no” ).\\nAs the construction of these symbolic reasoning tasks is\\nwell-deﬁned, for each task we consider an in-domain test\\nset for which examples had the same number of steps as\\nthe training/few-shot exemplars, as well as an out-of-domain (OOD) test set, for which evaluation\\nexamples had more steps than those in the exemplars. For last letter concatenation, the model only\\nsees exemplars of names with two words, and then performs last letter concatenation on names with 3\\nand 4 words.4We do the same for the number of potential ﬂips in the coin ﬂip task. Our experimental\\nsetup uses the same methods and models as in the prior two sections. We again manually compose\\nchains of thought for the few-shot exemplars for each task, which are given in Figure 3.\\nResults. The results of these in-domain and OOD evaluations are shown in Figure 8 for PaLM,\\nwith results for LaMDA shown in Appendix Table 5. With PaLM 540B, chain-of-thought prompting\\nleads to almost 100% solve rates (note that standard prompting already solves coin ﬂip with PaLM\\n540, though not for LaMDA 137B). Note that these in-domain evaluations are “toy tasks” in the\\nsense that perfect solution structures are already provided by the chains of thought in the few-shot\\nexemplars; all the model has to do is repeat the same steps with the new symbols in the test-time\\nexample. And yet, small models still fail—the ability to perform abstract manipulations on unseen\\nsymbols for these three tasks only arises at the scale of 100B model parameters.\\nAs for the OOD evaluations, standard prompting fails for both tasks. With chain-of-thought prompting,\\nlanguage models achieve upward scaling curves (though performance is lower than in the in-domain\\nsetting). Hence, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of\\nthought for language models of sufﬁcient scale.\\n6 Discussion\\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple mechanism for eliciting multi-step rea-\\nsoning behavior in large language models. We ﬁrst saw that chain-of-thought prompting improves\\nperformance by a large margin on arithmetic reasoning, yielding improvements that are much stronger\\nthan ablations and robust to different annotators, exemplars, and language models (Section 3). Next,\\n3We tested 10 common names using GPT-3 davinci and it got all but one correct.\\n4For names of length longer than 2 words, we concatenate multiple ﬁrst and last names together.\\n8', doc_id='0cf8f301-dd07-46bb-b981-287c989da79d', embedding=None, doc_hash='dc8a4aa833ddaed440953b79461749a465fbbaf92f817e84cfdc2b9b4f6b9c09', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='experiments on commonsense reasoning underscored how the linguistic nature of chain-of-thought\\nreasoning makes it generally applicable (Section 4). Finally, we showed that for symbolic reasoning,\\nchain-of-thought prompting facilitates OOD generalization to longer sequence lengths (Section 5). In\\nall experiments, chain-of-thought reasoning is elicited simply by prompting an off-the-shelf language\\nmodel. No language models were ﬁnetuned in the process of writing this paper.\\nThe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale has been a prevailing theme\\n(Wei et al., 2022b). For many reasoning tasks where standard prompting has a ﬂat scaling curve, chain-\\nof-thought prompting leads to dramatically increasing scaling curves. Chain-of-thought prompting\\nappears to expand the set of tasks that large language models can perform successfully—in other\\nwords, our work underscores that standard prompting only provides a lower bound on the capabilities\\nof large language models. This observation likely raises more questions than it answers—for instance,\\nhow much more can we expect reasoning ability to improve with a further increase in model scale?\\nWhat other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?\\nAs for limitations, we ﬁrst qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of\\nhuman reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually “reasoning,” which\\nwe leave as an open question. Second, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with\\nchains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for\\nﬁnetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot\\ngeneralization). Third, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct\\nand incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for\\nfuture work (Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022, inter alia ). Finally,\\nthe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model scales makes it costly to serve in\\nreal-world applications; further research could explore how to induce reasoning in smaller models.\\n7 Related Work\\nThis work is inspired by many research areas, which we detail in an extended related work section\\n(Appendix C). Here we describe two directions and associated papers that are perhaps most relevant.\\nThe ﬁrst relevant direction is using intermediate steps to solve reasoning problems. Ling et al. (2017)\\npioneer the idea of using natural language rationales to solve math word problems through a series\\nof intermediate steps. Their work is a remarkable contrast to the literature using formal languages\\nto reason (Roy et al., 2015; Chiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Cobbe\\net al. (2021) extend Ling et al. (2017) by creating a larger dataset and using it to ﬁnetune a pretrained\\nlanguage model rather than training a model from scratch. In the domain of program synthesis,\\nNye et al. (2021) leverage language models to predict the ﬁnal outputs of Python programs via\\nﬁrst line-to-line predicting the intermediate computational results, and show that their step-by-step\\nprediction method performs better than directly predicting the ﬁnal outputs.\\nNaturally, this paper also relates closely to the large body of recent work on prompting. Since the\\npopularization of few-shot prompting as given by Brown et al. (2020), several general approaches\\nhave improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al.,\\n2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang\\net al., 2022). Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g.,\\ninstructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the\\noutputs of language models with a chain of thought.\\n8 Conclusions\\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhanc-\\ning reasoning in language models. Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense\\nreasoning, we ﬁnd that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows\\nsufﬁciently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have ﬂat scaling curves.\\nBroadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire\\nfurther work on language-based approaches to reasoning.\\n9', doc_id='bd398e6a-3b2d-4d6b-8a75-b9674e502f23', embedding=None, doc_hash='5a433da1c6dd9442d80a1ee4698045745c82439180addbd7cbca9b5a21fed62b', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='Acknowledgements\\nWe thank Jacob Devlin, Claire Cui, Andrew Dai, and Ellie Pavlick for providing feedback on the\\npaper.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer beneﬁts such as improved\\nperformance and sample efﬁciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The “other category” included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters ﬁxed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were ﬁxed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often conﬂated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors ﬁxed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B ﬁxed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The ﬁrst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires sufﬁcient model scale. Finally, we\\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a ﬁnal answer that could be\\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a ﬁnal answer.\\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc). Future work could more thoroughly\\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\\n16', doc_id='f28141a3-959a-4d72-949d-88fc9c3670d2', embedding=None, doc_hash='1725b9443ebfc0152f6d8cafee43e66b0a3f9a4f308c19e80ed061f104fa7acb', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text=\"Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden.

There is no shortage\\nof work showing that prompts affect language models in unexpected ways (Min et al., 2022). The\\ngeneral way that we created chain of thought annotations was by taking eight exemplars from the\\ntraining set and decomposing the reasoning process into multiple steps leading to the ﬁnal answer.\\nExamples of chain of thought annotations are provided in Figure 3, with full prompts given in\\nAppendix G. To analyze how sensitive chain of thought is to prompt engineering, we performed\\nrobustness experiments with respect to various factors.\\n•Different annotators. We ﬁrst analyze robustness to three different annotators (Section 3.4 and\\nFigure 6). Although there is notable variance in performance (which we will discuss later), chain\\nof thought performed better than the baseline by a large margin for all three annotators on eight\\ndatasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Table 6 and Table 7). Similar to the\\nannotation process in Cobbe et al. (2021), annotators were not given speciﬁc instructions about\\n17\", doc_id='f1e1ef55-fcf7-48a7-9abf-aad05867a93a', embedding=None, doc_hash='f2dcdab9d77f0af134f1c74d6e02c3a824ed8164012a081940bde5e55766c18e', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='how to write the chain of thought annotations other than to simply write the step-by-step reasoning\\nprocess that led to the ﬁnal answer. Thus, the annotations were written in each annotator’s own\\nlinguistic “chain of thought” writing style.\\n•Annotators without machine learning background. The GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021)\\nconveniently provides a training set with reasoning chains written by crowd compute workers,\\nwhich enables us to investigate whether chain of thought still works with reasoning chains from an\\nindependent source without a background in machine learning. So we randomly sampled three sets\\nof eight exemplars with chains of thought from GSM8K. These chain of thought annotations also\\noutperformed the baseline by a large margin for all four arithmetic datasets (Table 6), indicating\\nthat chain of thought is not dependent on a particular set of annotators.\\n•Different exemplars. The different GSM8K exemplars experiment above (Table 6) also shows\\nthat chain-of-thought prompting works for different sets of exemplars. Notably, we test every set of\\nexemplars on all four arithmetic datasets (instead of picking exemplars from the training set for\\neach dataset), which suggests that the exemplars do not necessarily have to come from the same\\ndataset distribution as the test examples.\\n•Different order of exemplars. Prior work has shown that in some cases (e.g., classiﬁcation) even\\nthe order of prompts matter—varying the permutation of few-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy\\nof GPT-3 on SST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near SOTA (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).\\nWe show the standard deviation of performance from different exemplars in Table 6 and Table 7.\\nStandard deviations with respect to prompt order are relatively minimal in almost all cases. The\\none exception is the coin ﬂip task, for which exemplar orders have high standard deviation, likely\\nfor the reason cited in Zhao et al. (2021)—for classiﬁcation, many exemplars of the same category\\nin a row biases the model outputs).\\n•Different number of exemplars. We also found that gains from chain-of-thought prompting\\ngenerally still held when there was a varying number of few-shot exemplars. This is shown for ﬁve\\ndatasets in Figure 11 (we did not have the compute to run this for all datasets). We also found in\\npreliminary experiments that further increasing the number of exemplars in standard prompting\\ndid not lead to signiﬁcant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\\n•Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models. We ﬁnd that with the same\\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\\nTable 5). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\\nfor arithmetic reasoning, we want to be clear that prompt engineering still does matter, and can\\nimprove performance signiﬁcantly in many cases. Though most chain of thought annotations\\noutperform standard prompting, there is large variation in many cases. For instance, for the coin\\nﬂip task, the performance varied from 99.6% for Annotator A to 71.4% for Annotator C, though\\nboth were above standard prompting = 50.0% (see Table 7). There are even tasks where prompt\\nengineering is a requirement for good performance. In preliminary experiments, we tried using chain\\nof thought to enable language models to reverse the order of a list of 5 items. While two co-authors\\nwere not able to write chain of thought prompts that solved the task despite their best attempts, a third\\nco-author was able to write a chain of thought that perfectly solved the task.\\nHow to generate chain of thought annotations in a robust fashion could be an interesting direction\\nfor future work. For instance, an idea here could be to use a large language model to automatically\\ngenerate chains of thought via prompting (and potentially optimize this over a validation set).\\nA.3 Will chain-of-thought prompting improve performance for my task of interest?\\nWhile chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more\\nhelpful for some tasks than others. Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain\\nof thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires\\n18', doc_id='45d2ae85-321d-4e7c-b10e-477043d378da', embedding=None, doc_hash='7d53a9f051c845097dba0324ba4d0854a9ccc26927c87397eff36932ce6a12f9', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='multi-step reasoning, (2) a large language model is used, and (3) the scaling curve is relatively ﬂat.\\nConversely, the beneﬁts are smaller when one or more of these conditions are not met.\\nThese intuitions are perhaps supported by the arithmetic reasoning results. The performance gain\\nfrom chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step\\nproblems, ﬂat scaling curve), which meets these conditions. The performance gain is small for the\\nsubsets of MAWPS that only require one or two steps (SingleOP, SingleEq, and AddSub), for which\\nPaLM 540B already achieves performance of 90% or higher (and it is also generally true that there is\\nless headroom for improvement when performance is already strong).\\nAlthough in this paper we focused on multi-step reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, and\\nsymbolic), chain-of-thought prompting can potentially be applied to any task for which humans use a\\n“chain of thought” to solve (at least in principle). We leave the empirical evaluation of chain-of-thought\\nprompting on such diverse tasks (e.g., machine translation, etc.) to future work.\\nA.4 Why is prompting with the equation only not enough for some arithmetic reasoning\\ndatasets?\\nPrompting with the equation only as an intermediate step does help on many datasets, especially when\\nthe datasets only require a few reasoning steps (SV AMP, ASDiv, MAWPS). For GSM8K, however,\\nusing the equation only did not improve performance substantially. Based on qualitative analysis, we\\nbelieve that these questions are too semantically challenging for the model to directly translate them\\ninto a math equation. Consider this example from LaMDA 137B:\\nQUESTION :Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the ﬁrst 20 minutes, he scores 4\\npoints. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. How many total points did he\\nscore?\\nEQUATION ONLY (WRONG ANSWER ):(4 + 20 * 0.25) = 6. The answer is 6.\\nCHAIN OF THOUGHT (CORRECT ):Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the ﬁrst\\n20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. So\\nhe scored 25% more in the second 20 minutes. 4 x 1.25 = 5. So he scored 5 points in the\\nsecond 20 minutes. So he scored 9 points in total. The answer is 9.\\nIt is hard for the model to directly translate all of the semantics into a single equation, but chain of\\nthought allows it to better reason about each part of the question via intermediate steps in natural\\nlanguage.\\n19', doc_id='c9d16afe-9fbf-43fd-957d-a2d32660ca85', embedding=None, doc_hash='09b3f1d9c7b9186cb0b2b1e6da1446bb5ddc6b35b62404ad173f3be1db5a4156', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='B All Experimental Results\\nThis section contains tables for experimental results for varying models and model sizes, on all\\nbenchmarks, for standard prompting vs. chain-of-thought prompting.\\nFor the arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, some chains of thought (along with the equations produced)\\nwere correct, except the model performed an arithmetic operation incorrectly.

(2020), and see Liu et al. (2021) for a\\nsurvey). This paper falls in the category of general prompting approaches, whereby input prompts are\\noptimized to allow a single large language model to better perform a variety of tasks (Li and Liang,\\n2021; Lester et al., 2021; Reif et al., 2022, inter alia ).\\nOne recent line of work aims to improve the ability of language models to perform a task by providing\\ninstructions that describe the task (Raffel et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). This line of work is related because it also augments input–output\\npairs with meta-data. But whereas an instruction augments the input to a task (instructions are typically\\nprepended to the inputs), chain-of-thought prompting augments the outputs of language models.\\nAnother related direction is sequentially combining the outputs of language models; human–computer\\ninteraction (HCI) work (Wu et al., 2022a,b) has shown that combining sequential generations of\\nlanguage models improves task outcomes in a 20-person user study.\\nC.2 Natural language explanations\\nAnother closely related direction uses natural language explanations (NLEs), often with the goal of\\nimproving model interpretability (Zhou et al., 2020; Wiegreffe and Marasovi ´c, 2021, inter alia ). That\\nline of work typically focuses on natural language inference (Camburu et al., 2018; Yordanov et al.,\\n2021; Bostrom et al., 2021), and produces explanations either simultaneously to or after the ﬁnal\\nprediction (Narang et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2021; Wiegreffe et al., 2021, 2022). By contrast,\\nthe chain of thought processing considered in this paper occurs before the ﬁnal answer. And while\\nNLE aims mostly to improve neural network interpretability (Rajagopal et al., 2021), the goal of\\nchain-of-thought prompting is to allow models to decompose multi-hop reasoning tasks into multiple\\nsteps—interpretability is just a side effect. Marasovi ´c et al. (2022) show that prompt-based ﬁnetuning\\nwith NLE improves NLI and classiﬁcation performance, though they largely focus on evaluating\\nexplanation plausibility. In comparison, our work focuses on a range of arithmetic, commonsense,\\nand symbolic tasks that require multi-hop reasoning.\\nC.3 Program synthesis and execution\\nUsing intermediate reasoning steps has a long history in program synthesis and execution (Zaremba\\nand Sutskever, 2014, inter alia ). Recent work along in this direction has included a number of\\narchitectural innovations (Cai et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020), as well as the use of\\nlarge language models (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). The program execution work closest to\\nours is perhaps Nye et al. (2021), which show that large language models can perform up to 10-digit\\naddition, evaluate polynomials, and execute python programs. Whereas generating a program and\\nthen executing it can be viewed as a type of reasoning, our work generalizes such domain-speciﬁc\\nprimitives to natural language, which is open-domain and relevant to any text-to-text NLP task in\\nprinciple.\\nC.4 Numeric and logical reasoning\\nNumeric and logical reasoning has been a long-studied task in machine learning and natural language\\nprocessing (Lev et al., 2004, inter alia ). Recent work has also aimed to inject numeric reasoning\\nabilities in language models in various ways, such as augmenting BERT with a predeﬁned set of\\nexecutable operations (Andor et al., 2019), including a graph neural network (Ran et al., 2019), and\\nusing specialized training procedures (Pi˛ ekos et al., 2021). Another line of work aims to enable\\nlanguage models to perform logical or formal reasoning, often by verablizing the rules in natural\\nlanguage formal rules using language (Clark et al., 2020; Saeed et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021).\\n24', doc_id='7858ed73-5e51-4bab-aaa9-e5ee2c2f0112', embedding=None, doc_hash='18ccbe33c75c84aa7d47da63d52c204a84a045fcd87ac260a8ef3e5acbe1bc2b', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='Perhaps the most-related work here is Recchia (2021), which shows that ﬁnetuning enables longhand\\nmodule operations, which has previously been difﬁcult for performers. Whereas work in this direction\\nis often task-speciﬁc and uses ﬁnetuning, we show that chain-of-thought prompting works for a broad\\nrange of tasks without any ﬁnetuning.\\nC.5 Intermediate language steps\\nExtensive prior work has shown the beneﬁts of endowing neural networks with the ability to produce\\nintermediate steps via training or ﬁnetuning confers various beneﬁts in a range of scenarios. As\\nexamples, it has been shown that natural language intermediate steps can improve performance\\n(Zaidan et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2021; Hase and Bansal, 2022; Gu et al., 2022), improve robustness\\n(Chen et al., 2022), speed up training (Hancock et al., 2018), mitigate bias (Dua et al., 2020), and\\neven help in image and reinforcement learning settings (Andreas et al., 2018). To endow models with\\nthe ability to produce intermediate steps, prior work typically ﬁnetunes models on either manually\\nannotated training datasets (Camburu et al., 2018; Rajani et al., 2019, inter alia ) or generates synthetic\\ndatasets (Talmor et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022). Compared with these training or ﬁnetuning\\nmethods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-\\nshelf language models of sufﬁcient scale simply via prompting. This prompting setup is important\\nbecause it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and\\nbecause a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.\\nD Appendix: Additional Analysis\\nD.1 Correct Chain of Thought Analysis\\nAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from LaMDA 137B that led to\\ncorrect answers in the GSM8K dataset. Of these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through\\nincorrect reasoning (shown in Table 9: “correct by chance”). The other 49 had correct logic and\\nmath, with examples shown in Table 8. Five had minor imperfections while maintaining coherent and\\nunderstandable logic:\\n• One had underspeciﬁed statements (shown in Table 9: “correct but underspeciﬁed statements”).\\n•One made an unrelated but correct statement (shown in Table 9: “correct but unrelated statement”).\\n•Two had the correct logic but omitted speciﬁc steps in the equation, though it was still understand-\\nable (shown in Table 9: “correct but imperfect equation”).\\n•One had the correct math but inverted the semantics (shown in Table 9: “correct but inverted\\nsemantics”)\\nTable 8: Example of correct chains of thought produced by the model for the GSM8K dataset.\\nQUESTION :James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total\\nmeters does he run a week?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each\\nsprint. So he runs 60 meters x 3 sprints x 3 times a week. That is 60 meters x 9. The answer is 540. X\\nQUESTION :Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s\\niPhone. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon’s iPhone?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): Brandon’s iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Ben’s iPhone is 2\\ntimes older than Suzy’s iPhone. So Brandon’s iPhone is 4 x 2 = 8 times older than Suzy’s iPhone. Suzy’s iPhone\\nis 1 year old. So Brandon’s iPhone is 8 x 1 = 8 years old. The answer is 8. X\\nQUESTION :Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops. With the remaining lollipops, Jean wants to\\npackage 2 lollipops in one bag. How many bags can Jean ﬁll?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): Jean started with 30 lollipops. She ate 2 of them. So she has 28 lollipops\\nleft. She wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.\\nAnother one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. How many penguins are still left sunbathing?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BY CHANCE ):There are 36 penguins. One-third of them jump in and swim in\\nthe ocean. So that is 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. So that is 12 penguins.\\nThe answer is 12.\\nQUESTION :John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. There are an\\nadditional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. How many total windows are there between the\\nhouses?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNDERSPECIFIED STATEMENTS ):There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms\\neach. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. So there are 2 x 3 = 6 windows in each house. There are an additional\\n4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. So there are 4 + 4 = 8 windows in each house. So there are\\n6 x 2 = 12 windows in each house. So there are 12 + 8 = 20 windows in both houses. The answer is 20.\\nQUESTION :If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, how old will her brother be in 3 years?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNRELATED STATEMENT ):Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her\\nage. So her brother is 18 years old. In 3 years, she will be 12. So her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. The\\nanswer is 21.\\nQUESTION :A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon. An app company is offering $.20 cashback per\\ngallon if you ﬁll up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the\\ncashback rewards?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT IMPERFECT EQUATION ):The gas is originally 3 dollars per gallon. If\\nyou buy 10 gallons, that is 3 x 10 = 30 dollars. If you get 20 cents off per gallon, that is 20 x 10 = 2 dollars. So\\nthe total is 30 - 2 = 28 dollars. The answer is 28 dollars.\\nQUESTION :Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store’s Santa village. A third of\\nthe elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. How\\nmany elves are left?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT IMPERFECT EQUATION ):Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of\\nthem quit. So 60 - 1/3 = 40 elves are left. Then 10 elves quit. So 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left. The answer is 30\\nelves.\\nQUESTION :Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the ﬁreman’s luncheon.

There are many ways that a chain of thought can be incorrect, making the design\\nof error categorization non-trivial. We decided to categorize errors into what changes are needed to\\nmake the chain of thought correct, with the goal of elucidating how the model can be improved in the\\nfuture.\\nWe found that many chains of thought can be made correct with one of the following three classes of\\nmodiﬁcation.\\n•Calculator error only. We found that 8% of the chains of thought were completely correct except\\nfor a calculator error—in other words, applying an external calculator to equations, as done in\\nCobbe et al. (2021), would make the chain of thought correct. An example of this type of error is\\nshown in Table 10: “calculator error only”. Indeed, the solve rate of chain-of-thought prompting\\non for LaMDA 137B GSM8K went up from 14.3% to 17.3% when we added a Python program\\nas an external calculator, as shown in Table 2. Also, 34% of the examples contained calculator\\nerrors in addition to other types of errors. However, we perform the rest of the error categorization\\nindependently of calculator errors.\\n•Symbol mapping error. We next found that 16% percent of the chains of thought were correct\\nexcept for what we call symbol mapping errors. We deﬁne a symbol mapping error as when the\\nchain of thought is correct except for the number symbols, and it could be made totally correct by\\nmodifying only the equations and not the words. As one might argue that they could simply place\\nthe correct ﬁnal equation in any chain of thought, we constrain this category to chains of thought\\nwhere the chain of thought can be modiﬁed to be a completely correct reasoning process (not just\\nﬁnal answer). An example of this error category is shown in Table 10: “symbol mapping error”.\\n•One step missing error. Our next category of error is chains of thought which were correct except\\nthat they were missing a single step. In other words, these chains of thoughts could be rewritten to\\nbe correct by adding in an additional reasoning step that was missed by the model. An example of\\nthis error category is shown in Table 10: “one step missing error”. We found that 22% percent of\\nthe errors fell into this category.\\nTable 10: Example of incorrect chains of thought, categorized as described in Appendix D.2.\\nQUESTION :Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns\\nare there total?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;CALCULATOR ERROR ONLY ):Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush\\nhas 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. So 3 x 25 x 8 = 300. The answer is 300. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The produced chain of thought could be made correct just by\\nrunning the equation through an external calculator, instead of asking the model to do the computation.\\nQUESTION :Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a\\nyear, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what’s her annual salary?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;SYMBOL MAPPING ERROR ):Jill gets paid 20 dollars per hour to teach\\nand 30 dollars per hour to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher\\nand 15 hours a week as a coach, then she works 50 x 35 = 1750 hours as a teacher and 15 x 30 = 450 hours as a\\ncoach. So she works 1750 + 450 = 2200 hours. She gets paid 20 dollars per hour for 1750 hours and 30 dollars\\nper hour for 450 hours. So her annual salary is 20 x 1750 + 30 x 450 = $36,500. The answer is $36,500. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The model incorrectly mapped “15 x 30” instead of “15 x 50”, and\\nthe chain of thought would be made correct by ﬁxing just that one change (with an external calculator).\\nQUESTION :Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having\\ntwice as many instructions as the ﬁrst one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two\\ndishes?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;ONE STEP MISSING ERROR ):Kelian has two recipes. One has 20 instruc-\\ntions. The other has twice as many instructions as the ﬁrst one. So the second one has 40 instructions. So Kelian\\nhas to read 40 instructions to prepare the two dishes.

How many gold coins\\ndoes Gretchen have?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING ERROR ):Gretchen has 110 coins. There\\nare 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So there are 110 - 30 = 80 silver coins. So there are 80 silver coins and\\n110 - 80 = 30 gold coins.

The rest enrolled in hip-hop\\ndance. So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the percentage of the students\\nenrolled in hip-hop dance, minus the percentage of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, minus the\\npercentage of the students enrolled in jazz dance. So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop\\ndance is (25 + 20) - (25 + 20) = 100%. The answer is 100%. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :This chain of thought is incoherent in that the percent of entire\\nstudents enrolled in hip-hope dance cannot be the percent of student enrolled in hip-hop dance minus another\\nterm.\\nOverall, there are no guarantees that the reasoning processes generated by large language models\\nare coherent or factually correct, as underscored by the recent work evaluating the factuality of\\nlanguage model generations and explanations (Maynez et al., 2020; Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and\\nDurrett, 2022; Marasovi ´c et al., 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022). Incorrect reasoning processes can lead\\nto both incorrect ﬁnal answers as well as accidentally correct ﬁnal answers (with accidentally correct\\nﬁnal answers being more likely for tasks such as binary classiﬁcation as opposed to free response).\\nImproving the factuality of language model generations with respect to context and world knowledge\\nis an important direction open problems in language model research and could also be expected to\\npotentially improve multi-step reasoning abilities of language models. One potential method for\\nimproving the quality of decoding could involve generating multiple reasoning paths and scoring\\neach of them with a veriﬁer, though this requires training the veriﬁer (Cobbe et al., 2021; Shen et al.,\\n2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022).\\nD.3 Additional Robustness Analysis\\nAs the experiments in the main paper use a ﬁxed number of few-shot exemplars (8; as constrained by\\nthe input length of 1024 tokens), we verify that the chain-of-thought prompting is robust to various\\nnumbers of few-shot exemplars. We run experiments for LaMDA 137B, comparing chain-of-thought\\nprompting with standard prompting for the ﬁve datasets where standard prompting had a mostly ﬂat\\nscaling curve (the largest model did not achieve high performance). As shown in Figure 11, the\\nimprovement of chain-of-thought prompting over standard prompting remains robust to varying the\\nnumber of few-shot exemplars in the prompt.\\n28', doc_id='b4f534a9-150b-42ef-a478-5d5492f216f5', embedding=None, doc_hash='144e7c60db958b6f0150d8298bbbec668f75352cc27e3df20048adc2f624f112', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='12468051015 Solve rate (%)GSM8K\\n124680204060MultiArith\\n(MAWPS)\\n124680255075100\\nNumber of few-shot exemplarsSports\\nUnderstandingStandard prompting\\nChain of thought prompting\\n124680255075100Coin Flip\\n12340255075100Last Letter\\nConcatenation\\nFigure 11: The improvement of chain of thought prompting over standard prompting appears robust\\nto varying the number of few-shot exemplars in the prompt.\\nTable 12: Summary of math word problem benchmarks we use in this paper with examples.

Introduction\\nSentence representation learning is a fundamental problem in natural lan-\\nguage processing (NLP). It learns to encode sentences into compact, dense\\nvectors, called embeddings, which can be broadly useful for a wide range of\\ntasks, such as Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) [1], language understanding\\nand evaluation [2, 3] and information retrieval [4, 5].\\nRecent work has shown that finetuning pre-trained language models with\\ncontrastive learning is the most effective and efficient for sentence represen-\\ntation learning. The instance of contrastive learning makes embeddings of\\nsemantically similar pairs close to each other while pushing dissimilar ones\\napart [6]. In contrastive learning, previous methods [7, 8, 9] use multiple ways\\nto construct sentence pairs for supervised or unsupervised training. Specifi-\\ncally, supervised contrastive methods [7, 10] usually create sentence pairs us-\\ning several publicly available Natural language inference (NLI) datasets, like\\nStanford NLI (SNLI) dataset [11] and MultiGenre NLI (MNLI) dataset [12].\\nMeanwhile, unsupervised contrastive methods [7, 13, 14] leverage unlabeled\\nsentences from Wikipedia or any other public resources. In general, super-\\nvised contrastive learning methods outperform unsupervised ones although\\nthe former need multi-source large-scale labeled training data. Usually, previ-\\nous research follows the standard evaluation protocol that uses the SentEval\\ntoolkit [15] on the standard semantic textual similarity (STS) benchmark for\\nevaluation purposes. Accordingly, several benchmark datasets for STS and\\nNLI have been released by targeting at English.\\nWhen it comes to Japanese, things are different. Although JSNLI [22]\\nand JSICK [23] datasets are publicly available, STS12-16 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],\\nSTS-B [21] and 7 transfer tasks from SentEval [15], and MNLI datasets [12]\\nin Japanese do not exist. Here, JSNLI dataset is translated from the SNLI\\ndataset using machine translation, and JSICK dataset is made manually\\nbased on the SICK [24] dataset. We believe that the lack of publicly avail-\\nable benchmark datasets for Japanese STS has led to the lack of interest in\\nbuilding Japanese sentence representation models and devising applications\\nbased on them. Motivated by this, we believe it is time to construct and\\nrelease a comprehensive Japanese STS benchmark. In addition, we publish\\n2', doc_id='11917601-b123-40e9-915d-ddcc64da876d', embedding=None, doc_hash='dee3b3f4a4691df41ca213dfa61e371ad6a93e5dc797d88d5a6a434abf856180', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='various Japanese sentence embedding models trained mainly by contrastive\\nlearning and propose a novel effectively method as our core work of this paper\\nfor the domain-specific downstream tasks.\\nIn this context, we propose an efficient Japanese sentence representation\\nlearning framework that leverages data generation to perform contrastive\\nlearning on domain-specific downstream tasks. This framework is named\\nJCSE that is derived from “Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings\\nfor Japanese”. JCSE is built upon pre-trained transformer language mod-\\nels [25, 26]. We first collect a domain-specific raw corpus in a target domain.\\nAfterward, we finetune a pre-trained data generator (in our case T5 [26]) on\\nour collected domain-specific corpus using unsupervised fill-in-the-blank-style\\ndenoising training. It is then used to construct negative (contradictory) pairs\\nfor input sentences. In previous research [23], Japanese language models pre-\\ndict entailment labels without considering word order or case particles. The\\nexperimental settings for whether the existence of case particles can change\\nentailment labels [23] inspire us to investigate which word types in Japanese\\nare the most relevant for different Japanese language models. The results of\\nour relevant content words experiments [27] show that nouns are the most\\nrelevant content words in a Japanese sentence. It means that negative pairs\\nfor input sentences can be constructed by substituting nouns in them using\\nthe finetuned data generator. Referring to SimCSE [7], we construct pos-\\nitive pairs by simply using different dropout masks. In this way, sentence\\npairs are synthesized for contrastive learning. Finally, we apply a two-stage\\ncontrastive learning recipe that finetune a Japanese language model first on\\nsynthesized sentence pairs and then on JSNLI.\\nTo evaluate our method JCSE compared with various existing embedding\\nmethods, we choose multiple proper Japanese sentence embedding models\\nbased on the results of our established Japanese STS benchmark. On the STS\\nbenchmark, Japanese sentence embedding models yield similar results to the\\ncase of English, that is, applying contrastive learning to sentence embedding\\nmodels leads to performance improvements. Concern about our Japanese\\nSTS benchmark, as described above, STS12-16 and STS-B in Japanese still\\ndo not exist. Referring to previous research [22, 28], machine translation\\nis used to translate English STS12-16 and STS-B datasets into Japanese.\\nCombining the translated datasets with existing JSICK [23] and Japanese\\nSTS (JSTS) datasets included in the JGLUE [53], we construct and release\\n3', doc_id='bafd38cc-f38a-428b-8541-ba30fd7647ba', embedding=None, doc_hash='a23b0e5fa3f1e297a3946c0f0fdce3d5348de38e1f73f585e2aa38385eed0ffc', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='this comprehensive version of the Japanese STS benchmark1.\\nIn parallel, with the direct transfer of Japanese sentence embedding mod-\\nels to the two domain-specific downstream tasks, contrastive learning leads\\nto better performance than previous embedding methods, but those improve-\\nments are diminutive.

Here, viis the embedding of the ith\\nsentence and v+\\niis the one of a sentence semantically related to the ith sen-\\ntence. During training, v+\\niis considered a positive example for viand all\\nother examples in a batch are considered negatives [31, 32]. For a mini-batch\\nofNpairs, the contrastive loss function is defined as:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ, (1)\\nwhere τis a temperature hyperparameter, sim( v1, v2) is the cosine similarity\\nv1⊤v2\\n∥v1∥·∥v2∥. When additional negatives v−\\njare provided for vi, the contrastive\\nloss can be enhanced as:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1(esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ+esim(vi,v−\\nj)/τ). (2)\\nSimCSE [7] applies different hard negatives from other in-batch negatives,\\nextends Eq. 2 to incorporate weighting of different negatives:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1(esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ+α1j\\niesim(vi,v−\\nj)/τ), (3)\\nwhere 1j\\ni∈ {0,1}is an indicator that equals 1 if and only if i=j, and αis\\na weighting hyperparameter.\\nOne crucial question in contrastive learning is how to construct ( vi, v+\\ni)\\npairs. Some research [8, 9, 33] apply multiple augmentation techniques such\\nas word deletion, reordering, cutoff, and substitution. Kim et al. [34] directly\\nuse the hidden representation of BERT as well as its final sentence embed-\\ndings. SimCSE [7] simply feeds the same input to the encoder twice and\\nconstructs positive pairs using different dropout masks. This simple method\\nhas proved to be more effective than other strategies. Previous methods\\nmainly focus on constructing positive pairs while negative pairs are gener-\\nated through random sampling. Several works [35, 36] in the computer vision\\ncommunity show that hard negative examples are essential for contrastive\\nlearning. Robinson et al. [37] use an importance sampling method to select\\nhard negative examples. For NLP, Kalantidis et al. [38] improve MoCo [39]\\nby generating hard negative examples through mixing positive and nega-\\ntive examples in the memory bank which keeps a queue with features of the\\n5', doc_id='54d81575-cf10-4f81-8464-a352763d687b', embedding=None, doc_hash='9fe7b602e0f4a28700fe8a2ed6ae1fd6f26d17638c178509ae3c76a08d39f9e3', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='last few batches. MixCSE [13] constructs artificial hard negative features\\nvia mixing both positive and negative samples for unsupervised sentence\\nrepresentation learning. While supervised sentence representation learning\\nrelies on large-scale human-annotated sentence pairs, we often face with the\\nscarcity of human-annotated datasets, especially low-resource languages like\\nJapanese.\\n2.2. Domain Adaption for downstream task\\nDomain Adaptation is a fundamental challenge in NLP. The most com-\\nmon domain adaption technique for a pre-trained language model is domain-\\nadaptive pre-training which continues pre-taining on in-domain data. Recent\\nwork [40] has shown empirically that domain adaptation improves a language\\nmodel’s performance on a target domain. Specifically, the researchers in\\n[40] experiment with eight classification tasks ranging across four domains\\n(biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews). The\\nresults show that continued pre-training of an already powerful language\\nmodel on the domain consistently improves performance on tasks in a target\\ndomain. BioBERT [41] shows that pre-training BERT on biomedical cor-\\npora largely improves its performance on downstream tasks of biomedical\\ntext mining. Meanwhile, Guo et al. [42] and Ma et al. [43] show that neu-\\nral retrieval models trained on a general domain often do not transfer well,\\nespecially for specialized domains.\\nThere is no labeled training data in many target domains. To over-\\ncome this, leveraging generative models to produce synthetic data has been\\npreviously explored. Du et al. [44] first apply a seq2seq model for auto-\\nmatic question generation from text passages in a reading comprehension\\ntask. Puri et al. [45] first demonstrate that a QA model trained on purely\\nsynthetic questions and answers can outperform models trained on human-\\nlabeled data on SQuAD1.1. Ma et al. [43] and Liang et al. [46] use synthetic\\nqueries for domain adaptive neural retrieval. Yue et al. [47] leverage question\\ngeneration to synthesize QA pairs on clinical contexts and boost QA models\\nwithout requiring manual annotations. Another research [48] trains a QA\\nsystem on both source data and generated data from a target domain with\\na contrastive adaptation loss. However, to our best knowledge, there is no\\nrecent research that addresses domain adaptation in a domain-specific task\\ninvolving Japanese sentences.\\n6', doc_id='aae22a0e-6fe9-4157-8c9c-f6dfc0867ad2', embedding=None, doc_hash='e0a97884e3a5527f0c4c28dd2529cead97ebe5e22449f14c0f73b617bf37018f', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='2.3. Non-English data construction\\nWith the development of multilingual pre-trained language models, gen-\\neral language understanding frameworks for languages other than English\\nhave been created, and NLI datasets have been multilingualized. Conneau\\net al. [49] provided a cross-lingual NLI (XNLI) dataset by translating MNLI\\n[12] into 15 languages, including languages with few language resources such\\nas Urdu and Swahili. However, Japanese is not included in it.\\nAs examples of non-English datasets, OCNLI [50] is a Chinese NLI dataset\\nbuilt from original Chinese multi-genre resources. Ham et al. [28] create\\nKorNLI and KorSTS datasets by translating English NLI and STS-B [21]\\ndatasets into Korean. There are also attempts to translate the SICK dataset\\n[24] into Dutch [51] and Portuguese [52].\\nRegarding Japanese, a Japanese SNLI (JSNLI) dataset [22] is constructed\\nby employing machine translation to translate the English SNLI dataset into\\nJapanese and automatically filtering out unnatural sentences. JSICK [23]\\ndataset is manually translated from the English SICK dataset [24]. Ya-\\nhoo Japan constructs a Japanese GLUE benchmark [53] from scratch with-\\nout translation due to the cultural/social discrepancy between English and\\nJapanese. Although employing machine translation incurs several possibil-\\nities to produce unnatural sentences, it is more cost-efficient than manual\\ntranslation and reconstruction from scratch.\\n3.

In addition, private question-answer data are collected\\nby running a QAbot on Slack5which is a popular instant messaging software\\nand utilized in different courses of our department. We incorporate the data\\nfrom these three resources (Google Classroom, syllabus and QAbot data)\\nand do text normalization to get a clean Japanese educational computer sci-\\nence domain corpus. We publicly share this unique private corpus. All the\\ncorpora we collected are available here6.\\n3.2. Data generation\\nWe choose T5 [26] as our data generation model. More specifically, we\\napply the Japanese T5 Version 1.1 model which is an improved version of\\nthe original T5 model. This new version released by Google is built by\\nunsupervised pre-training and has not been fine-tuned on any downstream\\ntask. We formulate data generation as a fill-in-the-blank task where the T5\\nmodel predicts missing words within a corrupted piece of text in a text-to-\\ntext format.\\nAs described in Section 1, we find that nouns are the most relevant con-\\ntent words in Japanese sentences. Hence, for the target domain unlabeled\\nsentences, we first perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging for every sentence\\nusing GINZA and spaCy [54]. The POS-tags labels are determined using\\nspaCy [54]. Then we mask all noun tokens, more precisely mask noun chunks\\nrather than noun tokens to generate more natural data. Each corrupted noun\\nchunk is replaced by a sentinel token that is unique over the example. The\\nsentinel token is assigned a token ID that is unique to the sentence. The\\nsentinel IDs are special tokens that are added to the T5 model’s vocabulary\\nand do not correspond to any word piece [26]. We formulate our data gen-\\neration as a fill-in-the-blank task where the input is a sentence corrupted\\nwith multiple sentinel tokens and the target output is the relevant text in\\n5https://slack.com/\\n6https://github.com/mu-kindai/JCSE\\n9', doc_id='d759e6d1-1f06-41db-a033-23021b0573fd', embedding=None, doc_hash='4068c883cdc891faa1a24fa4fa79964f9c6d145848099b642149b8e22d92eed7', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='the missing location.

However, it is pre-trained on general domain\\ncorpora without considering sufficient knowledge of specific domains such as\\nclinical and computer science domains. Also, the word distribution of general\\nand specific domain corpora are quite different, so there is no ability for the\\npre-trained T5 model to generate proper domain-specific terms. Hence, it\\nis essential to finetune the pre-trained T5 model on unlabeled data in the\\ntarget domain using unsupervised denoising training.

Experiments\\nIn this section, we describe the experiments for this paper. To evaluate\\nthe performance of existing sentence representation methods and choose the\\nones compared to JCSE, first we establish a Japanese STS benchmark and\\nevaluate various Japanese sentence embedding models on it. Then we do\\nthe relevant content words experiments and find that nouns are the most\\nrelevant content words for Japanese language models. Afterward, we generate\\ncontradictory sentences using finetuned data generator and conduct domain\\nadaptation for down-stream tasks using contrastive learning with a two-stage\\ntraining recipe. Last, we evaluate JCSE compared with direct transfer and\\nother training strategies on two domain-specific downstream tasks. More\\nexperiment details are described following.\\n4.1. Japanese STS benchmark Construction\\nWe release a Japanese STS benchmark in our work. We combine the\\npublished JSICK [23] and JSTS [53] datasets with translated STS12-16 and\\nSTS-B datasets using machine translation. The translated datasets are de-\\nrived from original English datasets. We apply a similar translation strategy\\nby referring to the previous methods [22, 28].\\nFirst, we translate all of the STS12-16 and STS-B datasets into Japanese\\nusing Google translate API7and DeepL translate API8. Then, the translated\\nsentences are automatically filtered based on their BLEU scores [55]. More\\nspecifically, we translate each of the translated Japanese datasets back into\\nEnglish using the same machine translator, then we compute the BLEU1\\nscore between the original and translated English sentences. We find that\\nmost of the BLEU scores are 0 when using N > 1 ofN-gram, so we just apply\\nthe BLEU1 score. Unlike the previous research [22, 28], we do not translate\\nsentences in the development and test sets using human translation or post-\\nedit translation results by professional translators due to cost efficiency.\\nLast, to ensure the quality and decide on the translation data translated\\nfrom Google or DeepL translator, we conduct an experiment by referring to\\nthe previous method [22] that trains a linear regression model on different\\ntranslated data defined by diverse BLEU1 score thresholds. Detailedly, a\\nlinear model is built by adding a linear layer on the top layer’s CLS token of\\n7https://cloud.google.com/translate/\\n8https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api\\n11', doc_id='f45f01de-faea-4504-aed0-ab652bffd41c', embedding=None, doc_hash='3444d8132a3b96814409c146bc712107be0929778271b920ea10c30086018e3f', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='Google translator\\nBLEU threshold - 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3\\ndatasize 21172 20612 20449 19508 18207 16694 14904\\nMAE 0.4415 0.4443 0.4807 0.4493 0.4963 0.4966 0.4916\\nMSE 0.3384 0.336 0.3793 0.3332 0.412 0.4191 0.4018\\nR2 0.6481 0.6505 0.6058 0.6537 0.5727 0.5632 0.5822\\nDeepL translator\\nBLEU threshold - 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3\\ndatasize 21172 19337 19144 18368 17535 16683 15727\\nMAE 0.4206 0.433 0.4314 0.4397 0.451 0.4448 0.442\\nMSE 0.3058 0.3135 0.3117 0.324 0.342 0.3312 0.328\\nR2 0.6894 0.6802 0.6834 0.6711 0.6529 0.6638 0.6666\\nLast edition\\ndatasize 19330 MAE 0.4119 MSE 0.2821 R2 0.7137\\nTable 1: The performance of different models trained on different translated data.

We consider\\nboth unsupervised and supervised sentence representation models to apply a\\ncomprehensive evaluation. Unsupervised baselines include average FastText\\nembeddings [56], average BERT embeddings [25], and post-processing meth-\\nods such as BERT-flow [57] and BERT-whitening [58]. We also compare\\nseveral recent state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods including Sim-\\nCSE [7], MixCSE [13], and DiffCSE [14]. Other supervised methods include\\nSBERT [59], CoSENT9and SimCSE [7].\\nWe apply official codes to train a Japanese sentence embedding model\\nbased on each of the above-mentioned sentence representation methods. We\\ntried various hyperparameters in the training process, and find that the of-\\nficially recommended hyperparameters are better than others in most situa-\\ntions. Thus, in this section, all the Japanese sentence embedding models are\\ntrained in the hyperparameters referred to as relative officially recommended\\ntraining settings. The models trained based on BERT-base or BERT-large\\nusing their public checkpoints10.\\nFor unsupervised contrastive learning methods, we apply the Wikipedia\\n9https://github.com/bojone/CoSENT\\n10https://huggingface.co/cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese & https://huggingface.co/cl-\\ntohoku/bert-large-japanese\\n13', doc_id='c5e48776-4d4c-4738-a24d-3e96b480cc39', embedding=None, doc_hash='979a82d08663d047ef757e6deee38ffa4839fb28683dd288c2949c56269b1ae6', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='data as training data. We use WikiExtractor11and GiNZA to make unlabeled\\nsentences from the latest Japanese Wikipedia corpus, and randomly sample\\n106sentences as training data. For supervised methods, all the models are\\ntrained just on the JSNLI dataset due to data availability.\\nTable 3 shows the evaluation results. The performances of Japanese sen-\\ntence embedding models on the Japanese STS tasks is a little different from\\nthose on the English STS benchmark tasks. For the unsupervised methods,\\nrecent state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods perform better than pre-\\nvious baselines, and the MixCSE method shows the best or nearly best re-\\nsults on almost all STS tasks. Surprisingly, we find that models trained on\\nRoBERTa [60] pre-trained checkpoints12using a contrastive learning method\\nsuch as SimCSE (i.e., SimCSE-RoBERTa-base model) get poor results even\\nworse than previous baselines on some STS tasks, so we do not choose mod-\\nels trained on RoBERTa checkpoints to compare with JCSE. For supervised\\nmethods, the models using the contrastive learning method should achieve\\nbetter performance than the previous state-of-the-art SBERT [59] model, re-\\nversely, SBERT beyond SimCSE in our experiments because of much smaller\\ntraining data compared to those in the English experiments. Specifically, we\\nuse the JSNLI dataset which is about half of the training data in the English\\nexperiments [7], which uses the SNLI [11] and MNLI [12] datasets. This\\npoint easily overlooked in others research, but uncovered in our experiment.\\nThis is also the reason that unsupervised contrastive learning methods get\\nbetter performance than supervised contrastive learning methods in our ex-\\nperiments. After checking Table 3, we can find that the results on the human-\\nannotated STS datasets and the machine-translated datasets indicate differ-\\nent trends. This reflects the obvious gap between machine translation and\\nhuman annotation. To emphasize the performance on the human-annotated\\nSTS tasks, we also show the results just on JSICK and JSTS datasets in\\nTable 4. The results show that supervised contrastive learning methods\\nget nearly competitive performance compared with unsupervised contrastive\\nlearning methods even the labeled training data is limited. Contrastive learn-\\ning methods surpass previous methods which is similar with the results in\\nTable 3.\\n11https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor\\n12https://huggingface.co/nlp-waseda/roberta-base-japanese &\\nhttps://huggingface.co/nlp-waseda/roberta-large-japanese\\n14', doc_id='020447b3-4a56-4783-9338-ec10a8542731', embedding=None, doc_hash='45f7ee1581cb7eb14ec62b138fe6e2fd66b4d76e248184912135824ab2b0c280', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='Model STS12 STS13 STS14 STS15 STS16 STS-B JSICK JSTS Avg.\\nUnsupervised models\\nFastText embeddings (avg.) 42.78 51.71 42.45 54.24 54.06 51.30 74.76 60.23 53.94\\nBERT-base (first-last avg.) 38.66 52.06 36.41 55.69 57.06 51.39 71.97 65.19 53.55\\nBERT-base-flow 44.25 55.60 42.62 65.77 60.67 55.10 77.26 64.90 58.27\\nBERT-base-whitening 39.14 55.19 41.76 57.27 57.93 46.26 71.86 56.00 53.18\\nSimCSE-BERT-base 56.82 66.45 55.66 74.80 72.73 69.71 77.20 71.66 68.13\\nSimCSE-BERT-large 55.26 62.66 51.95 72.76 69.49 65.20 77.63 72.98 65.99\\nSimCSE-RoBERTa-base 48.65 60.09 46.97 66.10 65.29 59.88 72.32 63.82 60.39\\nMixCSE-BERT-base 55.07 67.45 56.94 74.35 73.11 70.21 76.97 71.85 68.24\\nMixCSE-BERT-large 56.56 64.59 54.84 74.55 70.85 67.76 78.15 73.89 67.65\\nDiffCSE-BERT-base 57.59 67.07 55.93 74.07 72.88 69.37 76.29 71.07 68.03\\nSupervised models\\nSBERT-base 58.79 60.51 53.30 68.64 66.59 64.76 65.25 75.28 64.14\\nSBERT-large 60.57 64.27 54.24 70.92 65.91 66.17 67.68 76.84 65.83\\nCoSENT 61.73 58.28 52.46 64.72 63.02 63.27 56.81 74.17 61.81\\nSimCSE-BERT-base 51.65 54.43 46.49 63.92 60.81 57.33 74.19 69.12 59.74\\nSimCSE-BERT-large 50.29 56.47 48.10 67.76 59.64 59.63 77.48 69.73 60.80\\nTable 3: Sentence embedding performance on STS tasks (Spearman’s correlation, “all”\\nsetting).

Relevant Content Words\\nThe core insight of JCSE is to generate target domain contradiction sen-\\ntence pairs for contrastive learning. As we described above, we find that\\nnouns are the most relevant content words and construct negative pairs for\\nthe anchor sentences by substituting noun phrases in them. Empirically, not\\nall word types play an equal role in determining the semantics of a Japanese\\nsentence. A previous study [23] insufficiently verifies this opinion but gives\\nus inspiration.\\nIn this section, we investigate which part-of-speech (POS) tags mainly\\ninfluence on examining if a Japanese sentence pair is semantically similar or\\nnot for different Japanese sentence embedding models. To measure this, we\\nborrow the approach used in TSDAE [27]. We select a sentence pair ( a, b)\\nthat is labeled as relevant and find the word that maximally reduces the\\ncosine-similarity score for the pair ( a, b):\\nˆw= argmaxw(cossim( a, b)−min(cossim( a\\\\w, b),cossim( a, b\\\\w))) (6)\\namong all words wthat appear in either a or b. We record the POS tags for\\nˆwand compute the distribution of POS tags among all sentence pairs. The\\nPOS tags are defined using spaCy [54].\\nThe results on the three datasets are shown in Figure 2. We find that\\nnouns (NOUN) are by far the most relevant content words in a Japanese sen-\\ntence across the three datasets, and we do not perceive significant differences\\nbetween all three datasets. This result is important for our method because\\nit experimentally validates the theoretical foundation of our method. That is,\\nit is practical to substitute nouns to construct contradiction sentence pairs.\\n4.4. Experiment Setting\\nIn this section, we describe two experiment settings in our method, in-\\ncluding data generation, and domain adaptation.\\nData generation : We bridge a gap between the scarcity of domain-\\nspecific data in low-resource language and the demand of sufficient training\\ndata for contrastive learning using data generation. In our work, we first fine-\\ntune the pre-trained T5-base checkpoint on the target domain corpus to get\\nour target domain data generator. Then we mask all noun chunks in every\\nsentence with unique sentinel tokens as an input of the data generator. Af-\\nterward, we apply a simple unsampled beam search decode algorithm [61, 62]\\n16', doc_id='6782a582-565b-4746-b9c6-35ef9c06e2ba', embedding=None, doc_hash='2db367c648b60e3280985225364bf7edfbda051e287b5c174564e5aafd8640e1', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='Figure 2: POS tags for the most relevant content words in sentences.

Our\\napproach automatically generates data in the target domain. Real examples\\nare shown in Table 5. For the finetune process, we initialize the T5 model\\nfrom public checkpoint12. We use Adafactor [64] as the optimizer and set\\nthe learning rate to 0.001 implemented using Pytorch and Huggingface and\\ntrained on three NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti.\\nDomain adaption : JCSE focuses on domain adaption characterized by\\nthe following two-stage contrastive learning recipe. A pre-trained sentence\\nembedding model is firstly adapted to a target domain by fine-tuning it on\\nthe synthesized generated sentence pairs. Then, the model is further fine-\\ntuned on labeled JSNLI data. We find that this training sequence, first on\\nthe synthesized generated data and then on JSNLI data, is better for our\\nmethod where reverse training sequence can harm the performance.\\nIn our experiment, both two training stages utilize the improved con-\\ntrastive learning method that incorporates different weighting with different\\nhard negatives. The training objective is described in section 3.3.

For the\\nQAbot dataset, it is a question retrieval task. Hence, we apply a simple\\nfirst-stage dense retrieval system with two-tower architecture by referring to\\nprevious studies [43, 46, 65]. More specifically, we extract the mean em-\\nbedding on top of layers to obtain the final query/question representation\\nfrom two-tower retrieval models consisting of two independent Japanese sen-\\ntence embedding models: one for each of the query and question towers, re-\\nspectively. We use Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rank\\n(MRR), and Precision at N (P@N) as the evaluation metrics.\\nDuring the evaluation process, we first consider the direct transfer sce-\\nnario where generated target domain data are not used for sentence em-\\nbedding training. Then we evaluate the model for domain adaption, where\\nsynthesized generated target domain data are used in stage one, and the\\ngeneral domain JSNLI data are used in stage two. We also combine the un-\\nlabeled target domain corpus with the Wikipedia corpus for the unsupervised\\ncontrastive learning method in the training process. The results for the two\\ntasks are shown in Table 6.\\nTable 6 shows that our method improves the performance through do-\\n20', doc_id='0a6ace49-bbe7-4215-8b66-7d137d699213', embedding=None, doc_hash='1811b9ab2d74bfa4131918db6d4215d206892b1ba986aa3546cb8255e74d5521', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='main adaptation using synthesized generated in-domain data. Even just\\nusing the generated data after the first stage of contrastive learning training\\ncan achieve competitive results compared with the out-of-the-box sentence\\nembedding models for direct transfer which means that the first stage train-\\ning uses much less training data than the data used in direct transfer but\\ngets improved performance. And further training using the JSNLI dataset\\ncan further improve our method’s performance after the second stage of con-\\ntrastive learning training. Superingsly, we also find that combining the in-\\ndomain corpus with the Wikipedia corpus in the training process can benefit\\nexisting unsupervised contrastive learning methods. The significant and con-\\nsistent improvements over the two tasks also demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nour data generation approach by fine-tuning a T5 model. Furthermore, com-\\npared to direct transfer and just directly integrating the in-domain corpus\\ninto existing contrastive learning methods, our approach achieves the best\\nperformance on almost all metrics with less training data scale, which con-\\nvincingly demonstrate that JCSE is an efficient and effective Japanese sen-\\ntence representation framework for better sentence embedding on Japanese\\ndomain-specific downstream tasks.\\n5. Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel effective Japanese sentence representa-\\ntion learning framework, JCSE, for the Japanese domain-specific downstream\\ntasks. Meanwhile, we establish Japanese STS benchmark to evaluate various\\nJapanese sentence embedding models using previous state-of-the-art sentence\\nrepresentation learning methods.\\nWe first collect a target domain corpus and finetune a pre-trained data\\ngenerator (T5 model) on this unlabeled data to get our target domain data\\ngenerator. Then, based on our relevant content words experiments, we substi-\\ntute all nouns in sentences by the data generator to generate contradictory\\nsentence pairs. Afterward, we use the synthesized target domain training\\ndata with contrastive learning to train a sentence embedding model. We\\nevaluate the models on two domain-specific downstream tasks, one of which\\nuses the QAbot dataset originally collected by us. Our method achieves\\nsignificantly better performance after the domain adaptation training, com-\\npared with direct transfer and current state-of-the-arts in Japanese. We\\nbelieve that JCSE paves a practicable way for domain-specific downstream\\ntasks in low-resource languages.\\n21', doc_id='657c3396-7e45-4d40-97fd-84254de12950', embedding=None, doc_hash='c4cef132d4c13e75783306ffcdb7bbea26a64eb9c775256a688fdf45f6718daa', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='Our future work includes the establishment of a new Japanese STS bench-\\nmark based on human annotation, in contrast to the current benchmark\\nbased on machine translation.

I NTRODUCTION\\nConversational large language models (LLMs) [1], such as\\nChatGPT [2], have generated immense interest in a range\\nof domains for tasks ranging from answering questions on\\nmedical licensing exams [3] to generating code snippets. Th is\\npaper focuses on enhancing the application of LLMs in severa l\\ndomains, such as helping developers code effectively and\\nefﬁciently with unfamiliar APIs or allowing students to acq uire\\nnew coding skills and techniques.\\nLLMs are particularly promising in domains where humans\\nand AI tools work together as trustworthy collaborators to\\nmore rapidly and reliably evolve software-reliant systems [4].\\nFor example, LLMs are being integrated directly into softwa re\\ntools, such as Github’s Co-Pilot [5]–[7] and included in int e-\\ngrated development environments (IDEs), such as IntelliJ [ 8]\\nand Visual Studio Code, thereby allowing software teams to\\naccess these tools directly from their preferred IDE.\\nA prompt [9] is a set of instructions provided to an\\nLLM that programs the LLM by customizing it and/or en-\\nhancing or reﬁning its capabilities . A prompt can inﬂuence\\nsubsequent interactions with—and output generated from—a nLLM by providing speciﬁc rules and guidelines for an LLM\\nconversation with a set of initial rules. In particular, a pr ompt\\nsets the context for the conversation and tells the LLM what\\ninformation is important and what the desired output form an d\\ncontent should be.\\nFor example, a prompt could specify that an LLM should\\nonly generate code that follows a certain coding style or\\nprogramming paradigm. Likewise, it could specify that an\\nLLM should ﬂag certain keywords or phrases in a generated\\ndocument and provide additional information related to tho se\\nkeywords. By introducing these guidelines, prompts facili tate\\nmore structured and nuanced outputs to aid a large variety of\\nsoftware engineering tasks in the context of LLMs.\\nPrompt engineering is the means by which LLMs are\\nprogrammed via prompts. To demonstrate the power of\\nprompt engineering, we provide the following prompt:\\nPrompt: “From now on, I would like you to ask me\\nquestions to deploy a Python application to AWS.\\nWhen you have enough information to deploy the\\napplication, create a Python script to automate the\\ndeployment.”\\nThis example prompt causes ChatGPT to begin asking the\\nuser questions about their software application. ChatGPT w ill\\ndrive the question-asking process until it reaches a point w here\\nit has sufﬁcient information to generate a Python script tha t\\nautomates deployment. This example demonstrates the pro-\\ngramming potential of prompts beyond conventional “genera te\\na method that does X” style prompts or “answer this quiz\\nquestion”.\\nMoreover, prompts can be engineered to program an LLM\\nto accomplish much more than simply dictating the output typ e\\nor ﬁltering the information provided to the model. With the\\nright prompt, it is possible to create entirely new interact ion\\nparadigms, such as having an LLM generate and give a quiz\\nassociated with a software engineering concept or tool, or\\neven simulate a Linux terminal window. Moreover, prompts\\nhave the potential for self-adaptation, suggesting other p rompts\\nto gather additional information or generate related artif acts.\\nThese advanced capabilities of prompts highlight the impor -\\ntance of engineering them to provide value beyond simple tex t\\nor code generation.\\nPrompt patterns are essential to effective prompt engi-\\nneering.

C OMPARING SOFTWARE PATTERNS\\nWITH PROMPT PATTERNS\\nThe quality of the output(s) generated by a conversational\\nLLM is directly related to the quality of the prompts provide d\\nby the user. As discussed in Section I, the prompts given to\\na conversational LLM can be used to program interactions\\nbetween a user and an LLM to better solve a variety of\\nproblems. One contribution of this paper is the framework it\\nprovides to document patterns that structure prompts to sol ve\\na range of software tasks that can be adapted to different\\ndomains.\\nThis framework is useful since it focuses on codifying\\npatterns that can be applied to help users better interact\\nwith conversational LLMs in a variety of contexts, rather\\nthan simply discussing interesting examples or domain-spe ciﬁc\\nprompts. Codifying this knowledge in pattern form enhances\\nreuse and transferability to other contexts and domains whe re\\nusers face similar—but not identical—problems.\\nThe topic of knowledge transfer has been studied exten-\\nsively in the software patterns literature [10], [11] at mul tiple\\nlevels, e.g., design, architectural, and analysis. This paper\\napplies a variant of a familiar pattern form as the basis of\\nour prompt engineering approach. Since prompts are a form\\nof programming, it is natural to document them in pattern\\nform.\\nA. Overview of Software Patterns\\nA software pattern provides a reusable solution to a recur-\\nring problem within a particular context [10]. Documenting\\nsoftware patterns concisely conveys (and generalizes) fro m\\nspeciﬁc problems being addressed to identify important for ces\\nand/or requirements that should be resolved and/or address ed\\nin successful solutions.\\nA pattern form also includes guidance on how to implement\\nthe pattern, as well as information on the trade-offs and\\nconsiderations to take into account when implementing a\\npattern. Moreover, example applications of the pattern are\\noften provided to further showcase the pattern’s utility in\\npractice. Software patterns are typically documented in astylized form to facilitate their use and understanding, su ch\\nas:\\n•A name and classiﬁcation . Each pattern has a name that\\nidentiﬁes the pattern and should be used consistently. A\\nclassiﬁcation groups patterns into broad categories, such\\nas creational, structural, or behavioral.\\n•The intent concisely conveys the purpose the pattern is\\nintended to achieve.\\n•The motivation documents the underlying problem the\\npattern is meant to solve and the importance of the\\nproblem.\\n•The structure and participants . The structure describes\\nthe different pattern participants (such as classes and\\nobjects) and how they collaborate to form a generalized\\nsolution.\\n•Example code concretely maps the pattern to some\\nunderlying programming language(s) and aids developers\\nin gaining greater insight into how that pattern can be\\napplied effectively.\\n•Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern in practice.\\nB. Overview of Prompt Patterns\\nPrompt patterns are similar to software patterns in that the y\\noffer reusable solutions to speciﬁc problems. They focus mo re\\nspeciﬁcally, however, on the context of output generation f rom\\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Just\\nas software patterns provide a codiﬁed approach to solving\\ncommon software development challenges, prompt patterns\\nprovide a codiﬁed approach to customizing the output and\\ninteractions of LLMs.\\nBy documenting and leveraging prompt patterns in the\\ncontext of automating software development tasks, individ ual\\nusers and teams can enforce constraints on the generated\\noutput, ensure that relevant information is included, and\\nchange the format of interaction with the LLM to better\\nsolve problems they face. Prompt patterns can be viewed as a\\ncorollary to the broad corpus of general software patterns, just\\nadapted to the more speciﬁc context of LLM output generation .\\nPrompt patterns follow a similar format to classic software\\npatterns, with slight modiﬁcations to match the context of\\noutput generation with LLMs.1Each of the analogous sections\\nfor the prompt pattern form used in this paper is summarized\\nbelow:\\n•A name and classiﬁcation . The prompt pattern name\\nuniquely identiﬁes the pattern and ideally indicates the\\nproblem that is being addressed. For the classiﬁcation,\\nwe have developed a series of initial categories of pattern\\ntypes, which are summarized in Table I and include\\nOutput Customization ,Error Identiﬁcation ,Prompt\\nImprovement ,Interaction , and Context Control .\\n•The intent and context describes the problem the prompt\\npattern solves and the goals it achieves.

The motivation\\nis explained in the context of users interacting with a\\nconversational LLM and how it can improve upon users\\ninformally prompting the LLM in one or more circum-\\nstances. Speciﬁc circumstances where the improvements\\nare expected are documented.\\n•The structure and key ideas . The structure describes\\nthe fundamental contextual information, as a series of\\nkey ideas, that the prompt pattern provides to the LLM.\\nThese ideas are similar to “participants” in a software pat-\\ntern. The contextual information may be communicated\\nthrough varying wording (just as a software pattern can\\nhave variations in how it is realized in code), but should\\nhave fundamental pieces of information that form a core\\nelement of the pattern.\\n•Example implementation demonstrates how the prompt\\npattern is worded in practice.\\n•Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern and may provide guidance on how to adapt\\nthe prompt to different contexts.\\nC. Evaluating Means for Deﬁning a Prompt Pattern’s Struc-\\nture and Ideas\\nIn software patterns, the structure and participants are\\nnormally deﬁned in terms of UML diagrams, such as structure\\ndiagrams and/or interaction diagrams. These UML diagrams\\nexplain what the participants of the pattern are and how they\\ninteract to solve the problem. In prompt patterns, somethin g\\nanalogous is needed, though UML may not be an appro-\\npriate structural documentation approach since it is inten ded\\nto describe software structures, as opposed to the ideas to\\ncommunicate in a prompt.\\nSeveral possible approaches could be used, ranging from di-\\nagrams to deﬁning grammars for a prompt language. Although\\ngrammars may seem attractive due to their formal nature, the y\\nalso incur the following challenges:\\n•The goal of prompts is to communicate knowledge in a\\nclear and concise way to conversation LLM users, who\\nmay or may not be computer scientists or programmers.\\nAs a community, we should strive to create an approach-\\nable format that communicates knowledge clearly to a\\ndiverse target audience.\\n•It is possible to phrase a prompt in many different ways.\\nIt is hard, however, to deﬁne a grammar that accurately\\nand completely expresses all the nuanced ways that\\ncomponents of a prompt could be expressed in text or\\nsymbols.\\n•Prompts fundamentally convey ideas to a conversational\\nLLM and are not simply the production of tokens for\\ninput. In particular, an idea built into a prompt pattern\\ncan be communicated in many ways and its expressionshould be at a higher-level than the underlying tokens\\nrepresenting the idea.\\n•It is possible to program an LLM to introduce novel\\nsemantics for statements and words that create new ways\\nfor communicating an idea. In contrast, grammars may\\nnot easily represent ideas that can be expressed through\\ncompletely new symbology or languages that the gram-\\nmar designer was not aware of.\\nD. A Way Forward: Fundamental Contextual Statements\\nAn open research question, therefore, is what approach is\\nmore effective than formal grammars for describing prompt\\npattern structure and ideas. We propose the concept of funda-\\nmental contextual statements , which are written descriptions\\nof the important ideas to communicate in a prompt to an LLM.\\nAn idea can be rewritten and expressed in arbitrary ways base d\\non user needs and experience. The key ideas to communicate,\\nhowever, are presented to the user as a series of simple, but\\nfundamental, statements.\\nOne beneﬁt of adopting and applying the fundamental con-\\ntextual statements approach is that it is intentionally int uitive\\nto users. In particular, we expect users will understand how to\\nexpress and adapt the statements in a contextually appropri ate\\nway for their domain. Moreover, since the underlying ideas o f\\nthe prompt are captured, these same ideas can be expressed\\nby the user in alternate symbology or wording that has been\\nintroduced to the LLM using patterns, such as the Meta\\nLanguage Creation pattern presented in Section III-B.\\nOur ultimate goal is to enhance prompt engineering by\\nproviding a framework for designing prompts that can be\\nreused and/or adapted to other LLMs in the same way that\\nsoftware patterns can be implemented in different program-\\nming languages and platforms. For the purposes of this paper ,\\nhowever, all prompts were tested with ChatGPT [12] using the\\nChatGPT+ service. We use ChatGPT as the LLM for all exam-\\nples presented in this paper due to its widespread availabil ity\\nand popularity. These examples were documented through a\\ncombination of exploring the corpus of community-posted\\nprompts on the Internet and independent prompt creation fro m\\nour use of ChatGPT to automating software development\\ntasks.\\nIII. A C ATALOG OF PROMPT PATTERNS\\nFOR CONVERSATIONAL LLM S\\nThis section presents our catalog of prompt patterns that\\nhave been applied to solve common problems in the domain\\nof conversational LLM interaction and output generation fo r\\nautomating software tasks. Each prompt pattern is accompa-\\nnied by concrete implementation samples and examples with\\nand without the prompt.\\nA. Summary of the Prompt Pattern Catalog\\nThe classiﬁcation of prompt patterns is an important consid -\\neration in documenting the patterns. Table I outlines the in itial\\nclassiﬁcations for the catalog of prompt patterns we identi ﬁed\\nin our work with ChatGPT thus far.', doc_id='31230306-c425-4ed7-b6b0-8f17356bf4db', embedding=None, doc_hash='43d20feae5909d977d81a65436413db61baf17038b5a7a14fe4f0cd223ff53bf', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='TABLE I\\nCLASSIFYING PROMPT PATTERNS\\nPattern Category Prompt Pattern\\nInput Semantics Meta Language Creation\\nOutput Output Automater\\nCustomization Persona\\nVisualization Generator\\nRecipe\\nTemplate\\nError Identiﬁcation Fact Check List\\nReﬂection\\nPrompt Question Reﬁnement\\nImprovement Alternative Approaches\\nCognitive Veriﬁer\\nRefusal Breaker\\nInteraction Flipped Interaction\\nGame Play\\nInﬁnite Generation\\nContext Control Context Manager\\nAs shown in this table, there are ﬁve categories of prompt\\npatterns in our classiﬁcation framework: Input Semantics ,\\nOutput Customization ,Error Identiﬁcation ,Prompt Im-\\nprovement , and Interaction , each of which is summarized\\nbelow.\\nThe Input Semantics category deals with how an LLM\\nunderstands the input and how it translates the input into\\nsomething it can use to generate output. This category in-\\ncludes the Meta Language Creation pattern, which focuses on\\ncreating a custom language for the LLM to understand. This\\npattern is useful when the default input language is ill-sui ted\\nfor expressing ideas the user wants to convey to the LLM.\\nTheOutput Customization category focuses on constrain-\\ning or tailoring the types, formats, structure, or other pro perties\\nof the output generated by the LLM. The prompt patterns in\\nthis category include Output Automater ,Persona ,Visualiza-\\ntion Generator ,Recipe , and Template patterns. The Output\\nAutomater pattern allows the user to create scripts that can\\nautomate any tasks the LLM output suggests the user should\\nperform. The Persona pattern gives the LLM a persona or role\\nto play when generating output. The Visualization Generator\\npattern allows the user to generate visualizations by produ cing\\ntextual outputs that can be fed to other tools, such as other\\nAI-based image generators, like DALL-E [13]. The Recipe\\npattern allows the user to obtain a sequence of steps or actio ns\\nto realize a stated end result, possibly with partially know n\\ninformation or constraints. The Template pattern allows the\\nuser to specify a template for the output, which the LLM ﬁlls\\nin with content.\\nThe Error Identiﬁcation category focuses on identifying\\nand resolving errors in the output generated by the LLM. Thiscategory includes the Fact Check List andReﬂection patterns.\\nThe Fact Check List pattern requires the LLM to generate a\\nlist of facts the output depends on that should be fact-check ed.\\nThe Reﬂection pattern requires the LLM to introspect on its\\noutput and identify any errors.\\nThe Prompt Improvement category focuses on improving\\nthe quality of the input and output. This category includes\\ntheQuestion Reﬁnement ,Alternative Approaches ,Cognitive\\nVeriﬁer , and Refusal Breaker patterns. The Question Reﬁne-\\nment pattern ensures the LLM always suggests a better version\\nof the user’s question. The Alternative Approaches pattern\\nrequires the LLM to suggest alternative ways of accomplishi ng\\na user-speciﬁed task. The Cognitive Veriﬁer pattern instructs\\nthe LLM to automatically suggest a series of subquestions\\nfor the user to answer before combining the answers to the\\nsubquestions and producing an answer to the overall questio n.\\nTheRefusal Breaker pattern requires the LLM to automatically\\nreword the user’s question when it refuses to produce an\\nanswer.\\nThe Interaction category focuses on the interaction be-\\ntween the user and the LLM. This category includes the\\nFlipped Interaction ,Game Play , and Inﬁnite Generation pat-\\nterns. The Flipped Interaction pattern requires the LLM to\\nask questions rather than generate output. The Game Play\\npattern requires the LLM to generate output in the form of\\na game. The Inﬁnite Generation pattern requires the LLM to\\ngenerate output indeﬁnitely without the user having to reen ter\\nthe generator prompt each time.\\nFinally, the Context Control category focuses on control-\\nling the contextual information in which the LLM operates.\\nThis category includes the Context Manager pattern, which\\nallows the user to specify the context for the LLM’s output.\\nThe remainder of this section describes each of these prompt\\npatterns using the pattern form discussed in Section II-B.\\nB. The Meta Language Creation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: During a conversation with an LLM,\\nthe user would like to create the prompt via an alternate\\nlanguage, such as a textual short-hand notation for graphs, a\\ndescription of states and state transitions for a state mach ine, a\\nset of commands for prompt automation, etc. The intent of thi s\\npattern is to explain the semantics of this alternative lang uage\\nto the LLM so the user can write future prompts using this\\nnew language and its semantics.\\n2) Motivation: Many problems, structures, or other ideas\\ncommunicated in a prompt may be more concisely, unam-\\nbiguously, or clearly expressed in a language other than\\nEnglish (or whatever conventional human language is used\\nto interact with an LLM). To produce output based on an\\nalternative language, however, an LLM needs to understand\\nthe language’s semantics.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen I say X, I mean Y (or would like you to do Y)', doc_id='b3d4061f-24f9-4440-8e5d-a92366fa4c11', embedding=None, doc_hash='000d96583f3ba45b2481d2f1e8db97e9e3b379794fe73e22128508833154ee6a', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='The key structure of this pattern involves explaining the\\nmeaning of one or more symbols, words, or statements to\\nthe LLM so it uses the provided semantics for the ensuing\\nconversation. This description can take the form of a simple\\ntranslation, such as “X” means “Y”. The description can also\\ntake more complex forms that deﬁne a series of commands\\nand their semantics, such as “when I say X, I want you to do\\n”. In this case, “X” is henceforth bound to the semantics of\\n“take action”.\\n4) Example Implementation: The key to successfully using\\ntheMeta Language Creation pattern is developing an unam-\\nbiguous notation or shorthand, such as the following:\\n“From now on, whenever I type two identiﬁers\\nseparated by a “ →”, I am describing a graph. For\\nexample, “a →b” is describing a graph with nodes\\n“a” and “b” and an edge between them. If I separate\\nidentiﬁers by “-[w:2, z:3] →”, I am adding properties\\nof the edge, such as a weight or label.”\\nThis example of the Meta Language Creation pattern estab-\\nlishes a standardized notation for describing graphs by deﬁ ning\\na convention for representing nodes and edges. Whenever the\\nauthor types two identiﬁers separated by a “ →” symbol, it is\\nan indication that a graph is being described. For example, i f\\nthe author types “a →b”, this indicates that a graph is being\\ndeﬁned with nodes “a” and “b”, and that there is an edge\\nbetween them. This convention provides a clear and concise\\nway to communicate the structure of a graph in written form.\\nMoreover, the prompt goes on to specify that additional\\ninformation about the edges, such as a weight or label, can\\nbe provided using the syntax “-[w:2, z:3] →”. This notation\\nallows for the speciﬁcation of additional properties beyon d\\nthe basic structure of the graph. The speciﬁed properties ar e\\nassociated with the edge between the two nodes and can\\nprovide important context for the interpretation of the gra ph.\\nThis standardized notation for describing graphs can make i t\\neasier to communicate graph structures and properties, whi ch\\nmay not be easy or are very verbose to describe as a series of\\nsentences.\\n5) Consequences: Although this pattern provides a pow-\\nerful means to customize a user’s interaction with an LLM,\\nit may create the potential for confusion within the LLM.\\nAs important as it is to clearly deﬁne the semantics of the\\nlanguage, it is also essential to ensure the language itself\\nintroduces no ambiguities that degrade the LLM’s performan ce\\nor accuracy. For example, the prompt “whenever I separate\\ntwo things by commas, it means that the ﬁrst thing precedes\\nthe second thing” will likely create signiﬁcant potential f or\\nambiguity and create the potential for unexpected semantic s\\nif punctuation involving commas is used in the prompt.\\nTo showcase the potential for confusion, ChatGPT will\\nwarn the user and potentially be unable to perform a speciﬁc\\nmapping of a symbol or term to a new meaning. For example,\\nif following prompt is given to ChatGPT\\n“Whenever I say “a”, I am referring to Marie An-\\ntoinette.”it will respond that this prompt creates too much confusion\\nas “a” is an indeﬁnite article and too commonly used, as shown\\nbelow:\\n“Referring to Marie Antoinette using “a” could\\npotentially cause confusion, as “a” is an indeﬁnite\\narticle commonly used to refer to a noun that has\\nnot been mentioned before. It may be more clear\\nto use her name, “Marie Antoinette”, or a pronoun\\nsuch as “she” or “her” to refer to her. Moreover,\\nusing context to establish who you are referring to\\ncan also help avoid confusion in conversation.”\\nIn general, an LLM will perform better on data it was\\ntrained on. Therefore, when an existing notation is availab le—\\nbut may not be the dominant meaning—the Meta Language\\nCreation pattern can provide context to scope the meaning of\\nthe symbol to improve the accurately and utility of the outpu t.\\nFor example, the symbol “ →” conveys slightly different infor-\\nmation in graphs and propositional logic. The statement “p →\\nq, q→p” may therefore make sense, but only if the LLM\\nis given the appropriate context through a Meta Language\\nCreation prompt.\\nAlthough Meta Language Creation is a powerful pattern it\\nmust be used carefully, particularly when describing conce pts\\nthat may otherwise be hard to precisely or concisely describ e.\\nThese types of prompts are thus best used in completely\\nnew conversation sessions. Using a single meta-language-p er-\\nconversation session may also be a best practice since it avo ids\\nthe potential for conﬂicting or unexpected semantics being\\napplied to the conversation over time.\\nC. The Output Automater Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to have\\nthe LLM generate a script or other automation artifact that c an\\nautomatically perform any steps it recommends taking as par t\\nof its output. The goal is to reduce the manual effort needed\\nto implement any LLM output recommendations.\\n2) Motivation: The output of an LLM is often a sequence\\nof steps for the user to follow. For example, when asking an\\nLLM to generate a Python conﬁguration script it may suggest\\na number of ﬁles to modify and changes to apply to each ﬁle.\\nHowever, having users continually perform the manual steps\\ndictated by LLM output is tedious and error-prone.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you produce an output that has at least one\\nstep to take and the following properties (alternatively,\\nalways do this)\\nProduce an executable artifact of type X that will\\nautomate these steps\\nThe ﬁrst part of the pattern identiﬁes the situations under\\nwhich automation should be generated. A simple approach\\nis to state that the output includes at least two steps to\\ntake and that an automation artifact should be produced. The', doc_id='758aa340-6c12-4c5e-803e-c12ade28f771', embedding=None, doc_hash='684de12b4526594ee7d9e700e993b84c75be9bf023e038d8dcfd1a00f2d61acc', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='scoping is up to the user, but helps prevent producing an\\noutput automation scripts in cases where running the output\\nautomation script will take more user effort than performin g\\nthe original steps produced in the output. The scope can be\\nlimited to outputs requiring more than a certain number of\\nsteps.\\nThe next part of this pattern provides a concrete statement\\nof the type of output the LLM should output to perform the\\nautomation. For example, “produce a Python script” gives th e\\nLLM a concrete understanding to translate the general steps\\ninto equivalent steps in Python. The automation artifact sh ould\\nbe concrete and must be something that the LLM associates\\nwith the action of “automating a sequence of steps”.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample of this prompt pat-\\ntern applied to code snippets generated by the ChatGPT LLM\\nis shown below:\\n“From now on, whenever you generate code that\\nspans more than one ﬁle, generate a Python script\\nthat can be run to automatically create the speciﬁed\\nﬁles or make changes to existing ﬁles to insert the\\ngenerated code.”\\nThis pattern is particularly effective in software enginee ring\\nas a common task for software engineers using LLMs is to\\nthen copy/paste the outputs into multiple ﬁles. Some tools,\\nsuch as Copilot, insert limited snippets directly into the s ection\\nof code that the coder is working with, but tools, such as\\nChatGPT, do not provide these facilities. This automation t rick\\nis also effective at creating scripts for running commands o n\\na terminal, automating cloud operations, or reorganizing ﬁ les\\non a ﬁle system.\\nThis pattern is a powerful complement for any system that\\ncan be computer controlled. The LLM can provide a set of\\nsteps that should be taken on the computer-controlled syste m\\nand then the output can be translated into a script that allow s\\nthe computer controlling the system to automatically take\\nthe steps. This is a direct pathway to allowing LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, to integrate quality into—and to control—new\\ncomputing systems that have a known scripting interface.\\n5) Consequences: An important usage consideration of\\nthis pattern is that the automation artifact must be deﬁned\\nconcretely. Without a concrete meaning for how to “automate ”\\nthe steps, the LLM often states that it “can’t automate thing s”\\nsince that is beyond its capabilities. LLMs typically accep t\\nrequests to produce code, however, so the goal is to instruct the\\nLLM to generate text/code, which can be executed to automate\\nsomething. This subtle distinction in meaning is important to\\nhelp an LLM disambiguate the prompt meaning.\\nOne caveat of the Output Automater pattern is the LLM\\nneeds sufﬁcient conversational context to generate an auto ma-\\ntion artifact that is functional in the target context, such as\\nthe ﬁle system of a project on a Mac vs. Windows computer.\\nThis pattern works best when the full context needed for the\\nautomation is contained within the conversation, e.g., when\\na software application is generated from scratch using the\\nconversation and all actions on the local ﬁle system are\\nperformed using a sequence of generated automation artifac tsrather than manual actions unknown to the LLM. Alternativel y,\\nself-contained sequences of steps work well, such as “how do\\nI ﬁnd the list of open ports on my Mac computer”.\\nIn some cases, the LLM may produce a long output with\\nmultiple steps and not include an automation artifact. This\\nomission may arise for various reasons, including exceedin g\\nthe output length limitation the LLM supports. A simple\\nworkaround for this situation is to remind the LLM via a\\nfollow-on prompt, such as “But you didn’t automate it”, whic h\\nprovides the context that the automation artifact was omitt ed\\nand should be generated.\\nAt this point in the evolution of LLMs, the Output Auto-\\nmater pattern is best employed by users who can read and\\nunderstand the generated automation artifact. LLMs can (an d\\ndo) produce inaccuracies in their output, so blindly accept ing\\nand executing an automation artifact carries signiﬁcant ri sk.\\nAlthough this pattern may alleviate the user from performin g\\ncertain manual steps, it does not alleviate their responsib ility\\nto understand the actions they undertake using the output.\\nWhen users execute automation scripts, therefore they assu me\\nresponsibility for the outcomes.\\nD. The Flipped Interaction Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: You want the LLM to ask questions\\nto obtain the information it needs to perform some tasks.\\nRather than the user driving the conversation, therefore, y ou\\nwant the LLM to drive the conversation to focus it on\\nachieving a speciﬁc goal. For example, you may want the\\nLLM to give you a quick quiz or automatically ask questions\\nuntil it has sufﬁcient information to generate a deployment\\nscript for your application to a particular cloud environme nt.\\n2) Motivation: Rather than having the user drives a con-\\nversation, an LLM often has knowledge it can use to more\\naccurately obtain information from the user. The goal of the\\nFlipped Interaction pattern is to ﬂip the interaction ﬂow so the\\nLLM asks the user questions to achieve some desired goal. The\\nLLM can often better select the format, number, and content\\nof the interactions to ensure that the goal is reached faster ,\\nmore accurately, and/or by using knowledge the user may not\\n(initially) possess.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to ask me questions to achieve X\\nYou should ask questions until this condition is met or\\nto achieve this goal (alternatively, forever)\\n(Optional) ask me the questions one at a time, two at\\na time, etc.\\nA prompt for a ﬂipped interaction should always specify the\\ngoal of the interaction. The ﬁrst idea ( i.e., you want the LLM to\\nask questions to achieve a goal) communicates this goal to th e\\nLLM. Equally important is that the questions should focus on a\\nparticular topic or outcome. By providing the goal, the LLM\\ncan understand what it is trying to accomplish through the\\ninteraction and tailor its questions accordingly. This “in version', doc_id='55d77146-b6fc-4c28-93c7-5b50f769b3c7', embedding=None, doc_hash='1d6f99c4b35e38b563ab635e73e7b1e19284c7595891cc6485bfa4566e4f9454', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='of control” enables more focused and efﬁcient interaction s ince\\nthe LLM will only ask questions that it deems relevant to\\nachieving the speciﬁed goal.\\nThe second idea provides the context for how long the in-\\nteraction should occur. A ﬂipped interaction can be termina ted\\nwith a response like “stop asking questions”. It is often bet ter,\\nhowever, to scope the interaction to a reasonable length or\\nonly as far as is needed to reach the goal. This goal can be\\nsurprisingly open-ended and the LLM will continue to work\\ntowards the goal by asking questions, as is the case in the\\nexample of ”until you have enough information to generate a\\nPython script”.\\nBy default, the LLM is likely to generate multiple questions\\nper iteration. The third idea is completely optional, but ca n\\nimprove usability by limiting (or expanding) the number of\\nquestions that the LLM generates per cycle. If a precise\\nnumber/format for the questioning is not speciﬁed, the ques -\\ntioning will be semi-random and may lead to one-at-a-time\\nquestions or ten-at-a-time questions. The prompt can thus b e\\ntailored to include the number of questions asked at a time,\\nthe order of the questions, and any other formatting/orderi ng\\nconsiderations to facilitate user interaction.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample prompt for a ﬂipped\\ninteraction is shown below:\\n“From now on, I would like you to ask me questions\\nto deploy a Python application to AWS. When you\\nhave enough information to deploy the application,\\ncreate a Python script to automate the deployment.”\\nIn general, the more speciﬁc the prompt regarding the\\nconstraints and information to collect, the better the outc ome.\\nFor instance, the example prompt above could provide a menu\\nof possible AWS services (such as Lambda, EC2, etc.) with\\nwhich to deploy the application. In other cases, the LLM may\\nbe permitted to simply make appropriate choices on its own fo r\\nthings that the user doesn’t explicitly make decisions abou t.\\nOne limitation of this prompt is that, once other contextual\\ninformation is provided regarding the task, it may require\\nexperimentation with the precise phrasing to get the LLM to\\nask the questions in the appropriate number and ﬂow to best\\nsuit the task, such as asking multiple questions at once vers us\\none question at a time.\\n5) Consequences: One consideration when designing the\\nprompt is how much to dictate to the LLM regarding what\\ninformation to collect prior to termination. In the example\\nabove, the ﬂipped interaction is open-ended and can vary sig -\\nniﬁcantly in the ﬁnal generated artifact. This open-endedn ess\\nmakes the prompt generic and reusable, but may potentially\\nask additional questions that could be skipped if more conte xt\\nis given.\\nIf speciﬁc requirements are known in advance, it is better to\\ninject them into the prompt rather than hoping the LLM will\\nobtain the needed information. Otherwise, the LLM will non-\\nnondeterministically decide whether to prompt the user for the\\ninformation or make an educated guess as to an appropriate\\nvalue.For example, the user can state that they would like to\\ndeploy an application to Amazon AWS EC2, rather than\\nsimply state ”the cloud” and require multiple interactions to\\nnarrow down the deployment target. The more precise the\\ninitial information, the better the LLM can use the limited\\nquestions that a user is likely willing to answer to obtain\\ninformation to improve its output.\\nWhen developing prompts for ﬂipped interactions, it is im-\\nportant to consider the level of user knowledge, engagement ,\\nand control. If the goal is to accomplish the goal with as litt le\\nuser interaction as possible (minimal control), that shoul d be\\nstated explicitly.Conversely, if the goal is to ensure the u ser\\nis aware of all key decisions and conﬁrms them (maximum\\nengagement) that should also be stated explicitly. Likewis e, if\\nthe user is expected to have minimal knowledge and should\\nhave the questions targeted at their level of expertise, thi s\\ninformation should be engineered into the prompt.\\nE. The Persona Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: In many cases, users would like\\nLLM output to always take a certain point of view or per-\\nspective. For example, it may be useful for to conduct a code\\nreview as if the LLM was a security expert. The intent of this\\npattern is to give the LLM a “persona” that helps it select wha t\\ntypes of output to generate and what details to focus on.\\n2) Motivation: Users may not know what types of outputs\\nor details are important for an LLM to focus on to achieve\\na given task. They may know, however, the role or type of\\nperson that they would normally ask to get help with these\\nthings. The Persona pattern enables the users to express what\\nthey need help with without knowing the exact details of the\\noutputs they need.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nAct as persona X\\nProvide outputs that persona X would create\\nThe ﬁrst statement conveys the idea that the LLM needs\\nto act as a speciﬁc persona and provide outputs that such a\\npersona would. This persona can be expressed in a number\\nof ways, ranging from a job description, title, ﬁctional cha r-\\nacter, historical ﬁgure, etc. The persona should elicit a se t\\nof attributes associated with a well-known job title, type o f\\nperson, etc.2\\nThe secondary idea—provide outputs that persona X would\\ncreate—offers opportunities for customization. For examp le, a\\nteacher might provide a large variety of different output ty pes,\\nranging from assignments to reading lists to lectures. If a m ore\\nspeciﬁc scope to the type of output is known, the user can\\nprovide it in this statement.\\n2Be aware, however, that personas relating to living people o r people\\nconsidered harmful make be disregarded due to underlying LL M privacy and\\nsecurity rules.', doc_id='ccc45156-8238-40e9-8d76-ac02890db75a', embedding=None, doc_hash='f67b5e5bc87de7429256da95d6cc068e3107879586ed0ea97e226c3bd3e2ea91', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='4) Example Implementation: A sample implementation for\\ncode review is shown below:\\n“From now on, act as a security reviewer. Pay close\\nattention to the security details of any code that\\nwe look at. Provide outputs that a security reviewer\\nwould regarding the code.”\\nIn this example, the LLM is instructed to provide outputs\\nthat a ”security reviewer” would. The prompt further sets th e\\nstage that code is going to be evaluated. Finally, the user\\nreﬁnes the persona by scoping the persona further to outputs\\nregarding the code.\\nPersonas can also represent inanimate or non-human en-\\ntities, such as a Linux terminal, a database, or an animal’s\\nperspective. When using this pattern to represent these ent ities,\\nit can be useful to also specify how you want the inputs\\ndelivered to the entity, such as “assume my input is what the\\nowner is saying to the dog and your output is the sounds the\\ndog is making”. An example prompt for a non-human entity\\nthat uses a “pretend to be” wording is shown below:\\n“You are going to pretend to be a Linux terminal\\nfor a computer that has been compromised by an\\nattacker. When I type in a command, you are going\\nto output the corresponding text that the Linux\\nterminal would produce.”\\nThis prompt is designed to simulate a computer that has\\nbeen compromised by an attacker and is being controlled\\nthrough a Linux terminal. The prompt speciﬁes that the user\\nwill input commands into the terminal, and in response, the\\nsimulated terminal will output the corresponding text that\\nwould be produced by a real Linux terminal. This prompt\\nis more prescriptive in the persona and asks the LLM to, not\\nonly be a Linux terminal, but to further act as a computer that\\nhas been compromised by an attacker.\\nThe persona causes ChatGPT to generate outputs to com-\\nmands that have ﬁles and contents indicative of a computer th at\\nwas hacked. The example illustrates how an LLM can bring\\nits situational awareness to a persona, in this case, creati ng\\nevidence of a cyberattack in the outputs it generates. This\\ntype of persona can be very effective for combining with the\\nGame Play pattern, where you want the exact details of the\\noutput characteristics to be hidden from the user (e.g., don ’t\\ngive away what the cyberattack did by describing it explicit ly\\nin the prompt).\\n5) Consequences: An interesting aspect of taking non-\\nhuman personas is that the LLM may make interesting as-\\nsumptions or “hallucinations” regarding the context. A wid ely\\ncirculated example on the Internet asks ChatGPT to act as\\na Linux terminal and produce the expected output that you\\nwould get if the user typed the same text into a terminal.\\nCommands, such as ls -l , will generate a ﬁle listing for an\\nimaginary UNIX ﬁle system, complete with ﬁles that can have\\ncat file1.txt run on them.\\nIn other examples, the LLM may prompt the user for more\\ncontext, such as when ChatGPT is asked to act as a MySQL\\ndatabase and prompts for the structure of a table that the use ris pretending to query. ChatGPT can then generate synthetic\\nrows, such as generating imaginary rows for a “people” table\\nwith columns for “name” and “job”.\\nF . The Question Reﬁnement Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern engages the LLM in\\nthe prompt engineering process. The intent of this pattern i s\\nto ensure the conversational LLM always suggests potential ly\\nbetter or more reﬁned questions the user could ask instead of\\ntheir original question. Using this pattern, the LLM can aid the\\nuser in ﬁnding the right question to ask in order to arrive at a n\\naccurate answer. In addition, the LLM may help the user ﬁnd\\nthe information or achieve their goal in fewer interactions with\\nthe user than if the user employed trial and error prompting.\\n2) Motivation: If a user is asking a question, it is possible\\nthey are not an expert in the domain and may not know the\\nbest way to phrase the question or be aware of additional\\ninformation helpful in phrasing the question. LLMs will oft en\\nstate limitations on the answer they are providing or reques t\\nadditional information to help them produce a more accurate\\nanswer. An LLM may also state assumptions it made in\\nproviding the answer. The motivation is that this additiona l\\ninformation or set of assumptions could be used to generate\\na better prompt. Rather than requiring the user to digest\\nand rephrase their prompt with the additional information,\\nthe LLM can directly reﬁne the prompt to incorporate the\\nadditional information.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, suggest a better version of the question\\nto use instead\\n(Optional) prompt me if I would like to use the better\\nversion instead\\nThe ﬁrst contextual statement in the prompt is asking the\\nLLM to suggest a better version of a question within a speciﬁc\\nscope. The scope is provided to ensure that not all questions\\nare automatically reworded or that they are reﬁned with a\\ngiven goal. The second contextual statement is meant for\\nautomation and allows the user to automatically use the reﬁn ed\\nquestion without having to copy/paste or manually enter it. The\\nengineering of this prompt can be further reﬁned by combinin g\\nit with the Reﬂection pattern, which allows the LLM to explain\\nwhy it believes the reﬁned question is an improvement.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question about a\\nsoftware artifact’s security, suggest a better version\\nof the question to use that incorporates information\\nspeciﬁc to security risks in the language or frame-\\nwork that I am using instead and ask me if I would\\nlike to use your question instead.”\\nIn the context of the example above, the LLM will use\\ntheQuestion Reﬁnement pattern to improve security-related\\nquestions by asking for or using speciﬁc details about the', doc_id='5f9a47f1-ae55-4495-a61a-d8f4423ab602', embedding=None, doc_hash='21c78889980f53991f4cd3fea45ad3f9a6a091529a3e7b55bd7c8223d0e34d79', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='software artifact and the language or framework used to buil d\\nit. For instance, if a developer of a Python web application w ith\\nFastAPI asks ChatGPT “How do I handle user authentication\\nin my web application?”, the LLM will reﬁne the question\\nby taking into account that the web application is written in\\nPython with FastAPI. The LLM then provides a revised ques-\\ntion that is more speciﬁc to the language and framework, such\\nas “What are the best practices for handling user authentica tion\\nsecurely in a FastAPI web application to mitigate common\\nsecurity risks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross- site\\nrequest forgery (CSRF), and session hijacking?”\\nThe additional detail in the revised question is likely\\nto not only make the user aware of issues they need to\\nconsider, but lead to a better answer from the LLM. For\\nsoftware engineering tasks, this pattern could also incorp orate\\ninformation regarding potential bugs, modularity, or othe r\\ncode quality considerations. Another approach would be to\\nautomatically reﬁne questions so the generated code cleanl y\\nseparates concerns or minimizes use of external libraries, such\\nas:\\nWhenever I ask a question about how to write some\\ncode, suggest a better version of my question that\\nasks how to write the code in a way that minimizes\\nmy dependencies on external libraries.\\n5) Consequences: The Question Reﬁnement pattern helps\\nbridge the gap between the user’s knowledge and the LLM’s\\nunderstanding, thereby yielding more efﬁcient and accurat e\\ninteractions. One risk of this pattern is its tendency to rap idly\\nnarrow the questioning by the user into a speciﬁc area that\\nguides the user down a more limited path of inquiry than\\nnecessary. The consequence of this narrowing is that the\\nuser may miss important ”bigger picture” information. One\\nsolution to this problem is to provide additional scope to th e\\npattern prompt, such as “do not scope my questions to speciﬁc\\nprogramming languages or frameworks.”\\nAnother approach to overcoming arbitrary narrowing or\\nlimited targeting of the reﬁned question is to combine the\\nQuestion Reﬁnement pattern with other patterns. In particular,\\nthis pattern can be combined with the Cognitive Veriﬁer pattern\\nso the LLM automatically produces a series of follow-up ques -\\ntions that can produce the reﬁned question. For example, in\\nthe following prompt the Question Reﬁnement andCognitive\\nVeriﬁer patterns are applied to ensure better questions are\\nposed to the LLM:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion.”\\nAs with many patterns that allow an LLM to generate\\nnew questions using its knowledge, the LLM may introduce\\nunfamiliar terms or concepts to the user into the question.\\nOne way to address this issue is to include a statement that\\nthe LLM should explain any unfamiliar terms it introduces in to\\nthe question. A further enhancement of this idea is to combin etheQuestion Reﬁnement pattern with the Persona pattern so\\nthe LLM ﬂags terms and generates deﬁnitions that assume a\\nparticular level of knowledge, such as this example:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion. After the follow-up questions, temporarily\\nact as a user with no knowledge of AWS and deﬁne\\nany terms that I need to know to accurately answer\\nthe questions.”\\nAn LLM can always produce factual inaccuracies, just\\nlike a human. A risk of this pattern is that the inaccuracies\\nare introduced into the reﬁned question. This risk may be\\nmitigated, however, by combining the Fact Check List pattern\\nto enable the user to identify possible inaccuracies and the\\nReﬂection pattern to explain the reasoning behind the question\\nreﬁnement.\\nG. The Alternative Approaches Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to ensure\\nan LLM always offers alternative ways of accomplishing a tas k\\nso a user does not pursue only the approaches with which they\\nare familiar. The LLM can provide alternative approaches th at\\nalways force the user to think about what they are doing and\\ndetermine if that is the best approach to meet reach their goa l.\\nIn addition, solving the task may inform the user or teach the m\\nabout alternative concepts for subsequent follow-up.\\n2) Motivation: Humans often suffer from cognitive biases\\nthat lead them to choose a particular approach to solve a\\nproblem even when it is not the right or “best” approach.\\nMoreover, humans may be unaware of alternative approaches\\nto what they have used in the past. The motivation of the\\nAlternative Approaches pattern is to ensure the user is aware\\nof alternative approaches to select a better approach to sol ve\\na problem by dissolving their cognitive biases.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, if there are alternative ways to accom-\\nplish the same thing, list the best alternate approaches\\n(Optional) compare/contrast the pros and cons of each\\napproach\\n(Optional) include the original way that I asked\\n(Optional) prompt me for which approach I would like\\nto use\\nThe ﬁrst statement, “within scope X”, scopes the interactio n\\nto a particular goal, topic, or bounds on the questioning. Th e\\nscope is the constraints that the user is placing on the alter -\\nnative approaches. The scope could be “for implementation\\ndecisions” or “for the deployment of the application”. The\\nscope ensures that any alternatives ﬁt within the boundarie s\\nor constraints that the user must adhere to.\\nThe second statement, “if there are alternative ways to\\naccomplish the same thing, list the best alternate approach es”', doc_id='c99b9c47-36cd-4a71-8b07-713ef86e02c7', embedding=None, doc_hash='099a84568fbde3987575773f6630f72dca898aa83e210226d73500c6fd79bcc6', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='instructs the LLM to suggest alternatives. As with other\\npatterns, the speciﬁcity of the instructions can be increas ed or\\ninclude domain-speciﬁc contextual information. For examp le,\\nthe statement could be scoped to “if there are alternative wa ys\\nto accomplish the same thing with the software framework tha t\\nI am using” to prevent the LLM from suggesting alternatives\\nthat are inherently non-viable because they would require t oo\\nmany changes to other parts of the application.\\nSince the user may not be aware of the alternative ap-\\nproaches, they also may not be aware of why one would\\nchoose one of the alternatives. The optional statement “com -\\npare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach” adds de-\\ncision making criteria to the analysis. This statement ensu res\\nthe LLM will provide the user with the necessary rationale\\nfor alternative approaches. The ﬁnal statement, “prompt me\\nfor which approach I would like to use”, helps eliminate the\\nuser needing to manually copy/paste or enter in an alternati ve\\napproach if one is selected.\\n4) Example Implementation: Example prompt implementa-\\ntion to generate, compare, and allow the user to select one or\\nmore alternative approaches:\\n“Whenever I ask you to deploy an application to\\na speciﬁc cloud service, if there are alternative\\nservices to accomplish the same thing with the\\nsame cloud service provider, list the best alternative\\nservices and then compare/contrast the pros and cons\\nof each approach with respect to cost, availability,\\nand maintenance effort and include the original way\\nthat I asked. Then ask me which approach I would\\nlike to proceed with.”\\nThis implementation of the Alternative Approaches pattern\\nis being speciﬁcally tailored for the context of software\\nengineering and focuses on the deployment of applications\\nto cloud services. The prompt is intended to intercept place s\\nwhere the developer may have made a cloud service selection\\nwithout full awareness of alternative services that may be\\npriced more competitively or easier to maintain. The prompt\\ndirects ChatGPT to list the best alternative services that c an\\naccomplish the same task with the same cloud service provide r\\n(providing constraints on the alternatives), and to compar e and\\ncontrast the pros and cons of each approach.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern is effective in its generic\\nform and can be applied to a range of tasks effectively.\\nReﬁnements could include having a standardized catalog of\\nacceptable alternatives in a speciﬁc domain from which the\\nuser must select. The Alternative Approaches pattern can also\\nbe used to incentivize users to select one of an approved set\\nof approaches while informing them of the pros/cons of the\\napproved options.\\nH. The Cognitive Veriﬁer Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: Research literature has documented\\nthat LLMs can often reason better if a question is subdivided\\ninto additional questions that provide answers combined in to\\nthe overall answer to the original question [14]. The intent of\\nthe pattern is to force the LLM to always subdivide questionsinto additional questions that can be used to provide a bette r\\nanswer to the original question.\\n2) Motivation: The motivation of the Cognitive Veriﬁer\\npattern is two-fold:\\n•Humans may initially ask questions that are too high-\\nlevel to provide a concrete answer to without additional\\nfollow-up due to unfamiliarity with the domain, laziness\\nin prompt entry, or being unsure about what the correct\\nphrasing of the question should be.\\n•Research has demonstrated that LLMs can often perform\\nbetter when using a question that is subdivided into\\nindividual questions.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen you are asked a question, follow these rules\\nGenerate a number of additional questions that would\\nhelp more accurately answer the question\\nCombine the answers to the individual questions to\\nproduce the ﬁnal answer to the overall question\\nThe ﬁrst statement is to generate a number of additional\\nquestions that would help more accurately answer the origin al\\nquestion. This step instructs the LLM to consider the contex t\\nof the question and to identify any information that may be\\nmissing or unclear. By generating additional questions, th e\\nLLM can help to ensure that the ﬁnal answer is as complete\\nand accurate as possible. This step also encourages critica l\\nthinking by the user and can help to uncover new insights or\\napproaches that may not have been considered initially, whi ch\\nsubsequently lead to better follow-on questions.\\nThe second statement is to combine the answers to the\\nindividual questions to produce the ﬁnal answer to the overa ll\\nquestion. This step is designed to ensure that all of the info r-\\nmation gathered from the individual questions is incorpora ted\\ninto the ﬁnal answer. By combining the answers, the LLM\\ncan provide a more comprehensive and accurate response to\\nthe original question. This step also helps to ensure that al l\\nrelevant information is taken into account and that the ﬁnal\\nanswer is not based on any single answer.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“When I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. When I have answered the three\\nquestions, combine the answers to produce the ﬁnal\\nanswers to my original question.”\\nThis speciﬁc instance of the prompt pattern adds a reﬁne-\\nment to the original pattern by specifying a set number of\\nadditional questions that the LLM should generate in respon se\\nto a question. In this case, the prompt speciﬁes that ChatGPT\\nshould generate three additional questions that would help to\\ngive a more accurate answer to the original question. The\\nspeciﬁc number can be based on the user’s experience and\\nwillingness to provide follow-up information. A reﬁnement\\nto the prompt can be to provide a context for the amount', doc_id='f05ab293-bec8-4302-a426-68e439a0f9b3', embedding=None, doc_hash='690d8a77918edd0d281c36761c67f1d463728ddbd9419e3fbe5f703ccd3389cc', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='of knowledge that the LLM can assume the user has in the\\ndomain to guide the creation of the additional questions:\\n“When I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. Assume that I know little about\\nthe topic that we are discussing and please deﬁne\\nany terms that are not general knowledge. When\\nI have answered the three questions, combine the\\nanswers to produce the ﬁnal answers to my original\\nquestion.”\\nThe reﬁnement also speciﬁes that the user may not have\\na strong understanding of the topic being discussed, which\\nmeans that the LLM should deﬁne any terms that are not\\ngeneral knowledge. This helps to ensure that the follow-up\\nquestions are not only relevant and focused, but also access ible\\nto the user, who may not be familiar with technical or domain-\\nspeciﬁc terms. By providing clear and concise deﬁnitions, t he\\nLLM can help to ensure that the follow-up questions are easy\\nto understand and that the ﬁnal answer is accessible to users\\nwith varying levels of knowledge and expertise.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can dictate the exact number\\nof questions to generate or leave this decision to the LLM.\\nThere are pros and cons to dictating the exact number. A pro\\nis that specifying an exact number of questions can tightly\\nscope the amount of additional information the user is force d\\nto provide so it is within a range they are willing and able to\\ncontribute.\\nA con, however, is that given Nquestions there may be\\nan invaluable N+1question that will always be scoped out.\\nAlternatively, the LLM can be provided a range or allowed\\nto ask additional questions. Of course, by omitting a limit o n\\nthe number of questions the LLM may generate numerous\\nadditional questions that overwhelm the user.\\nI. The Fact Check List Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to ensure\\nthat the LLM outputs a list of facts that are present in the\\noutput and form an important part of the statements in the\\noutput. This list of facts helps inform the user of the facts\\n(or assumptions) the output is based on. The user can then\\nperform appropriate due diligence on these facts/assumpti ons\\nto validate the veracity of the output.\\n2) Motivation: A current weakness of LLMs (including\\nChatGPT) is they often rapidly (and even enthusiastically! )\\ngenerate convincing text that is factually incorrect. Thes e\\nerrors can take a wide range of forms, including fake statist ics\\nto invalid version numbers for software library dependenci es.\\nDue to the convincing nature of this generated text, however ,\\nusers may not perform appropriate due diligence to determin e\\nits accuracy.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nGenerate a set of facts that are contained in the output\\nThe set of facts should be inserted in a speciﬁc point\\nin the output\\nThe set of facts should be the fundamental facts that\\ncould undermine the veracity of the output if any of\\nthem are incorrect\\nOne point of variation in this pattern is where the facts are\\noutput. Given that the facts may be terms that the user is not\\nfamiliar with, it is preferable if the list of facts comes aft er\\nthe output. This after-output presentation ordering allow s the\\nuser to read and understand the statements before seeing wha t\\nstatements should be checked. The user may also determine\\nadditional facts prior to realizing the fact list at the end s hould\\nbe checked.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample wording of the Fact\\nCheck List pattern is shown below:\\n“From now on, when you generate an answer, create\\na set of facts that the answer depends on that should\\nbe fact-checked and list this set of facts at the\\nend of your output. Only include facts related to\\ncybersecurity.”\\nThe user may have expertise in some topics related to the\\nquestion but not others. The fact check list can be tailored t o\\ntopics that the user is not as experienced in or where there\\nis the most risk. For example, in the prompt above, the user\\nis scoping the fact check list to security topics, since thes e\\nare likely very important from a risk perspective and may not\\nbe well-understood by the developer. Targeting the facts al so\\nreduces the cognitive burden on the user by potentially list ing\\nfewer items for investigation.\\n5) Consequences: The Fact Check List pattern should be\\nemployed whenever users are not experts in the domain for\\nwhich they are generating output. For example, a software\\ndeveloper reviewing code could beneﬁt from the pattern\\nsuggesting security considerations. In contrast, an exper t on\\nsoftware architecture is likely to identify errors in state ments\\nabout the software structure and need not see a fact check lis t\\nfor these outputs.\\nErrors are potential in all LLM outputs, so Fact Check List\\nis an effective pattern to combine with other patterns, such\\nas by combining it with the Question Reﬁnement pattern. A\\nkey aspect of this pattern is that users can inherently check it\\nagainst the output. In particular, users can directly compa re the\\nfact check list to the output to verify the facts listed in the fact\\ncheck list actually appear in the output. Users can also iden tify\\nany omissions from the list. Although the fact check list may\\nalso have errors, users often have sufﬁcient knowledge and\\ncontext to determine its completeness and accuracy relativ e to\\nthe output.\\nOne caveat of the Fact Check List pattern is that it only\\napplies when the output type is amenable to fact-checking. F or\\nexample, the pattern works when asking ChatGPT to generate\\na Python “requirements.txt” ﬁle since it will list the versi ons\\nof libraries as facts that should be checked, which is handy a s', doc_id='9febc9f4-79e9-48ad-92a2-47625b5ffa52', embedding=None, doc_hash='edffd59f1d7b717b4e55a4ea660a04e4ab33866f807b264069b21a792a3e6f35', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='the versions commonly have errors. However, ChatGPT will\\nrefuse to generate a fact check list for a code sample and\\nindicate that this is something it cannot check, even though\\nthe code may have errors.\\nJ. The Template Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to\\nensure an LLM’s output follows a precise template in terms of\\nstructure. For example, the user might need to generate a URL\\nthat inserts generated information into speciﬁc positions within\\nthe URL path. This pattern allows the user to instruct the LLM\\nto produce its output in a format it would not ordinarily use\\nfor the speciﬁed type of content being generated.\\n2) Motivation: In some cases, output must be produced in\\na precise format that is application or use-case speciﬁc and\\nnot known to the LLM. Since the LLM is not aware of the\\ntemplate structure, it must be instructed on what the format\\nis and where the different parts of its output should go. This\\ncould take the form of a sample data structure that is being\\ngenerated, a series of form letters being ﬁlled in, etc.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI am going to provide a template for your output\\nX is my placeholder for content\\nTry to ﬁt the output into one or more of the placehold-\\ners that I list\\nPlease preserve the formatting and overall template that\\nI provide\\nThis is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLD-\\nERS\\nThe ﬁrst statement directs the LLM to follow a speciﬁc\\ntemplate for its output. The template will be used to try and\\ncoerce the LLMs responses into a structure that is consisten t\\nwith the user’s formatting needs. This pattern is needed whe n\\nthe target format is not known to the LLM. If the LLM already\\nhas knowledge of the format, such as a speciﬁc ﬁle type, then\\nthe template pattern can be skipped and the user can simply\\nspecify the known format. However, there may be cases, such\\nas generating Javascript Object Notation (JSON), where the re\\nis a large amount of variation in how the data could be\\nrepresented within that format and the template can be used t o\\nensure that the representation within the target format mee ts\\nthe user’s additional constraints.\\nThe second statement makes the LLM aware that the\\ntemplate will contain a set of placeholders. Users will expl ain\\nhow the output should be inserted into the template through t he\\nplaceholders. The placeholders allow the user to semantica lly\\ntarget where information should be inserted. Placeholders\\ncan use formats, like NAME, that allow the LLM to infer\\nthe semantic meaning of to determine where output should\\nbe inserted (e.g., insert the person’s name in the NAME\\nplaceholder). Moreover, by using placeholders, the user ca n\\nindicate what is not needed in the output – if a placeholder\\ndoesn’t exist for a component of the generated output, thenthat component can be omitted. Ideally, placeholders shoul d\\nuse a format that is commonly employed in text that the LLM\\nwas trained on, such as all caps, enclosure in brackets, etc.\\nThe third statement attempts to constrain the LLM so that it\\ndoesn’t arbitrarily rewrite the template or attempt to modi fy it\\nso that all of the output components can be inserted. It shoul d\\nbe noted that this statement may not preclude additional tex t\\nfrom being generated before or after. In practice, LLMs will\\ntypically follow the template, but it is harder to eliminate any\\nadditional text being generated beyond the template withou t\\nexperimentation with prompt wording.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample template for gener-\\nating URLs where the output is put into speciﬁc places in the\\ntemplate is shown below:\\n“I am going to provide a template for your out-\\nput. Everything in all caps is a placeholder. Any\\ntime that you generate text, try to ﬁt it into one\\nof the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the\\nformatting and overall template that I provide at\\nhttps://myapi.com/NAME/proﬁle/JOB”\\nA sample interaction after the prompt was provided, is\\nshown:\\nUser: “Generate a name and job title for a person”\\nChatGPT: “https://myapi.com/Emily Parker/proﬁle/\\nSoftware Engineer”\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of applying the Tem-\\nplate pattern is that it ﬁlters the LLM’s output, which may\\neliminate other outputs the LLM would have provided that\\nmight be useful to the user. In many cases, the LLM can\\nprovide helpful descriptions of code, decision making, or o ther\\ndetails that this pattern will effectively eliminate from t he\\noutput. Users should therefore weight the pros/cons of ﬁlte ring\\nout this additional information.\\nIn addition, ﬁltering can make it hard to combine this patter n\\nwith other patterns from the Output Customization category.\\nThe Template pattern effectively constrains the output format,\\nso it may not be compatible with generation of certain other\\ntypes of output. For example, in the template provided above\\nfor a URL, it would not be easy (or likely possible) to combine\\nwith the Recipe pattern, which needs to output a list of steps.\\nK. The Inﬁnite Generation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to\\nautomatically generate a series of outputs (which may appea r\\ninﬁnite) without having to reenter the generator prompt eac h\\ntime. The goal is to limit how much text the user must type to\\nproduce the next output, based on the assumption that the use r\\ndoes not want to continually reintroduce the prompt. In some\\nvariations, the intent is to allow the user to keep an initial\\nprompt template, but add additional variation to it through\\nadditional inputs prior to each generated output.\\n2) Motivation: Many tasks require repetitive application of\\nthe same prompt to multiple concepts. For example, generati ng\\ncode for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations\\nfor a speciﬁc type of entity may require applying the same', doc_id='a32d1abb-cf3c-452e-bdd6-9daa4839a5e0', embedding=None, doc_hash='4b53a2edfa56b6ffce1e1077c9366a40116997e0016819c17d8e5b01f10f8da8', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='prompt to multiple types of entities. If the user is forced to\\nretype the prompt over and over, they may make mistakes. The\\nInﬁnite Generation pattern allows the user to repetitively apply\\na prompt, either with or without further input, to automate\\nthe generation of multiple outputs using a predeﬁned set of\\nconstraints.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to generate output forever, X output(s)\\nat a time.\\n(Optional) here is how to use the input I provide\\nbetween outputs.\\n(Optional) stop when I ask you to.\\nThe ﬁrst statement speciﬁes that the user wants the LLM\\nto generate output indeﬁnitely, which effectively conveys the\\ninformation that the same prompt is going to be reused over\\nand over. By specifying the number of outputs that should be\\ngenerated at a time (i.e. “X outputs at a time”), the user can\\nrate limit the generation, which can be particularly import ant if\\nthere is a risk that the output will exceed the length limitat ions\\nof the LLM for a single output.\\nThe second statement provides optional instructions for ho w\\nto use the input provided by the user between outputs. By\\nspecifying how additional user inputs between prompts can\\nbe provided and leveraged, the user can create a prompting\\nstrategy that leverages user feedback in the context of the\\noriginal prompt. The original prompt is still in the context of\\nthe generation, but each user input between generation step s\\nis incorporated into the original prompt to reﬁne the output\\nusing prescribed rules.\\nThe third statement provides an optional way for the user\\nto stop the output generation process. This step is not alway s\\nneeded, but can be useful in situations where there may be\\nthe potential for ambiguity regarding whether or not the use r-\\nprovided input between inputs is meant as a reﬁnement for\\nthe next generation or a command to stop. For example, an\\nexplicit stop phrase could be created if the user was generat ing\\ndata related to road signs, where the user might want to enter\\na reﬁnement of the generation like “stop” to indicate that a\\nstop sign should be added to the output.\\n4) Example Implementation: The following is a sample\\ninﬁnite generation prompt for producing a series of URLs:\\n“From now on, I want you to generate a name\\nand job until I say stop. I am going to provide a\\ntemplate for your output. Everything in all caps is a\\nplaceholder. Any time that you generate text, try to\\nﬁt it into one of the placeholders that I list. Please\\npreserve the formatting and overall template that I\\nprovide: https://myapi.com/NAME/proﬁle/JOB”\\nThis prompt is combining the functionality of both the\\nInﬁnite Generation pattern and the Template pattern. The user\\nis requesting the LLM continuously generate a name and job\\ntitle until explicitly told to “stop”. The generated output s are\\nthen formatted into the template provided, which includesplaceholders for the name and job title. By using the Inﬁnite\\nGeneration pattern, the user receives multiple outputs without\\nhaving to continually re-enter the template. Likewise, the\\nTemplate pattern is applied to provide a consistent format for\\nthe outputs.\\n5) Consequences: In conversational LLMs, the input to\\nthe model at each time step is the previous output and the\\nnew user input. Although the details of what is preserved\\nand reintroduced in the next output cycle are model and\\nimplementation dependent, they are often limited in scope. The\\nmodel is therefore constantly being fed the previous output s\\nand the prompt, which can result in the model losing track of\\nthe original prompt instructions over time if they exceed th e\\nscope of what it is being provided as input.\\nAs additional outputs are generated, the context surroundi ng\\nthe prompt may fade, leading to the model deviating from\\nthe intended behavior. It is important to monitor the output s\\nproduced by the model to (1) ensure it still adheres to\\nthe desired behavior and (2) provide corrective feedback if\\nnecessary. Another issue to consider is that the LLM may\\ngenerate repetitive outputs, which may not be desired since\\nusers ﬁnd this repetition tedious and error-prone to proces s.\\nL. The Visualization Generator Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to use\\ntext generation to create visualizations. Many concepts ar e\\neasier to grasp in diagram or image format. The purpose of\\nthis pattern is to create a pathway for the tool to produce\\nimagery that is associated with other outputs. This pattern\\nallows the creation of visualizations by creating inputs fo r\\nother well-known visualization tools that use text as their\\ninput, such as Graphviz Dot [15] or DALL-E [13]. This\\npattern can provide a more comprehensive and effective way\\nof communicating information by combining the strengths of\\nboth the text generation and visualization tools.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs generally produce text and cannot\\nproduce imagery. For example, an LLM cannot draw a diagram\\nto describe a graph. The Visualization Generator pattern over-\\ncomes this limitation by generating textual inputs in the co rrect\\nformat to plug into another tool that generates the correct\\ndiagram. The motivation behind this pattern is to enhance th e\\noutput of the LLM and make it more visually appealing and\\neasier to understand for users. By using text inputs to gener ate\\nvisualizations, users can quickly understand complex conc epts\\nand relationships that may be hard to grasp through text alon e.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nGenerate an X that I can provide to tool Y to visualize\\nit\\nThe goal of the contextual statements is to indicate to the\\nLLM that the output it is going to produce, “X”, is going to\\nbe imagery. Since LLMs can’t generate images, the ”that I\\ncan provide to tool Y to visualize it” clariﬁes that the LLM\\nis not expected to generate an image, but is instead expected', doc_id='c6eb11e8-3872-4e38-9420-8f808c771f9a', embedding=None, doc_hash='44669dbfc909636117540212c6112ee6e2b27795ec87f5424c3a300194b931b8', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='to produce a description of imagery consumable by tool Y for\\nproduction of the image.\\nMany tools may support multiple types of visualizations or\\nformats, and thus the target tool itself may not be sufﬁcient\\ninformation to accurately produce what the user wants. The\\nuser may need to state the precise types of visualizations (e .g.,\\nbar chart, directed graph, UML class diagram) that should be\\nproduced. For example, Graphviz Dot can create diagrams for\\nboth UML class diagrams and directed graphs. Further, as wil l\\nbe discussed in the following example, it can be advantageou s\\nto specify a list of possible tools and formats and let the LLM\\nselect the appropriate target for visualization.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“Whenever I ask you to visualize something, please\\ncreate either a Graphviz Dot ﬁle or DALL-E prompt\\nthat I can use to create the visualization. Choose\\nthe appropriate tools based on what needs to be\\nvisualized.”\\nThis example of the pattern adds a qualiﬁcation that the\\noutput type for the visualization can be either for Graphviz\\nor DALL-E. The interesting aspect of this approach is that\\nit allows the LLM to use its semantic understanding of the\\noutput format to automatically select the target tooling ba sed\\non what will be displayed. In this case, Graphviz would be for\\nvisualizing graphs with a need for an exactly deﬁned structu re.\\nDALL-E would be effective at visualizing realistic or artis tic\\nimagery that does not have an exactly deﬁned structure. The\\nLLM can select the tool based on the needs of the visualizatio n\\nand capabilities of each tool.\\n5) Consequences: The pattern creates a target pipeline\\nfor the output to render a visualization. The pipeline may\\ninclude AI generators, such as DALL-E, that can produce\\nrich visualizations. The pattern allows the user to expand t he\\nexpressive capabilities of the output into the visual domai n.\\nM. The Game Play Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to create\\na game around a given topic. The pattern can be combined\\nwith the Visualization Generator to add imagery to the game.\\nThe game is centered around a speciﬁc topic and the LLM\\nwill guide the game play. The pattern is particularly effect ive\\nwhen the rules of the game are relatively limited in scope, bu t\\nthe content for the game is expected to be wide in scope. The\\nuser can specify a limited set of rules and then the LLM can\\nautomate generation of bodies of content for game play.\\n2) Motivation: You would like the LLM to generate scenar-\\nios or questions revolving around a speciﬁc topic and requir e\\nusers to apply problem solving or other skills to accomplish\\na task related to the scenario. Generating all the content fo r\\nthe game manually would be too time consuming, however, so\\nyou would like the LLM to apply its knowledge of the topic\\nto guide the generation of content.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nCreate a game for me around X\\nOne or more fundamental rules of the game\\nThe ﬁrst statement, instructs the LLM to create a game and\\nprovides the important scoping of the game to a topic area. .\\nOne of the important capabilities of the pattern is that it al lows\\nthe user to create games by describing the rules of the game,\\nwithout having to determine the content of the game. The more\\nspeciﬁc the topic, typically the more novel and interesting the\\ngame play.\\nThe second statement introduces the rules of the game to the\\nLLM. It is important that the rules ﬁt within the capabilitie s\\nof the LLM. Textual games that rely on input and output text\\nsequences work best. One of the key attributes of the pattern\\nis that the input text can be rich and expressive, which can\\nlead to interesting interfaces for the game. For example, th e\\nuser might express actions in the game as scripts dictating\\na sequence of complex actions, such as “get a listing of all\\nnetwork activity and check it for anomalies”, which go beyon d\\nthe scope of multiple choice or short answer inputs. Each rul e\\nshould be provided as a separate statement regarding some\\naspect of the game.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample cybersecurity game\\nprompt is shown below:\\n“We are going to play a cybersecurity game. You\\nare going to pretend to be a Linux terminal for a\\ncomputer that has been compromised by an attacker.\\nWhen I type in a command, you are going to output\\nthe corresponding text that the Linux terminal would\\nproduce. I am going to use commands to try and\\nﬁgure out how the system was compromised. The\\nattack should have done one or more of the following\\nthings: (1) launched new processes, (2) changed\\nﬁles, (3) opened new ports to receive communi-\\ncation, (4) created new outbound connections, (5)\\nchanged passwords, (6) created new user accounts,\\nor (7) read and stolen information. To start the game,\\nprint a scenario of what happened that led to my\\ninvestigation and make the description have clues\\nthat I can use to get started.”\\nThis cybersecurity game prompt combines a number of pat-\\nterns, including Game Play andPersona . The Linux terminal\\npersona that is chosen for the game has been discussed in many\\nInternet posts [16]. This game further customizes the discu ssed\\nLinux persona to act as a Linux terminal of a computer\\ncompromised by a cyberattack. ChatGPT responds to Linux\\ncommands with appropriate terminal outputs and synthesize s\\na fake ﬁle system that has clues to a cyberattack.\\nSample output from this game with ChatGPT after typing\\nin “ls -alt”, the Linux command to generate a list of ﬁles in\\nthe current directory is shown below (permissions have been\\nremoved for formatting reasons):\\ntotal 56\\n5 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:31 .\\n1 user user 18881 Feb 16 14:31 .bash_history', doc_id='c9e581a7-f6c6-410d-92e1-829e2d10862a', embedding=None, doc_hash='f842ded0d9694b4775ff727b042847756e8fb30ace24c6af83f0ecd53268c74c', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='43 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:30 ..\\n1 user user 1178 Aug 15 2022 .bashrc\\n1 user user 220 Aug 15 2022 .bash_logout\\n3 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:25 .gnupg\\n1 user user 4041 Feb 15 17:52 README.md\\n2 user user 4096 Feb 1 11:35 project\\nWhen the user then typed the command “cat .bash history”,\\nto display the contents of the log ﬁle showing the commands\\nrun by the user, ChatGPT responded with:\\ncd /var/www/html\\nsudo rm -rf *\\nsudo wget https://example.com/backdoor.php\\nsudo chmod 777 backdoor.php\\nexit\\nls -alt\\nps -ef\\nnetstat -tulnp\\nIn the output above, ChatGPT generated a fake log ﬁle with\\nrealistic commands for deleting the data being served by the\\nweb server in /var/www/html and replacing the content\\nwith a backdoor into the system.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can be combined effectively\\nwith the Persona ,Inﬁnite Generation , and Visualization Gen-\\nerator patterns. For example, the cybersecurity game uses the\\nPersona pattern so the LLM can masquerade as a Linux termi-\\nnal. For a network security game, the Visualization Generator\\ncould be employed to add the ability to visualize the network\\ntopology and trafﬁc ﬂows.\\nN. The Reﬂection Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask\\nthe model to automatically explain the rationale behind giv en\\nanswers to the user. The pattern allows users to better asses s\\nthe output’s validity, as well as inform users how an LLM\\narrived at a particular answer. Reﬂection can clarify any po ints\\nof confusion, uncover underlying assumptions, and reveal g aps\\nin knowledge or understanding.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs can and do make mistakes. More-\\nover, users may not understand why an LLM is producing\\na particular output and how to adapt their prompt to solve\\na problem with the output. By asking LLM to automatically\\nexplain the rationale behind its answers, users can gain a be tter\\nunderstanding of how the model is processing the input, what\\nassumptions it is making, and what data it is drawing on.\\nLLMs may sometime provide incomplete, incorrect, or\\nambiguous answers. Reﬂection is an aid to help address these\\nshortcomings and ensure the information provided by LLM\\nis as accurate. A further beneﬁt of the pattern is that it can\\nhelp users debug their prompts and determine why they are\\nnot getting results that meet expectations. This pattern is\\nparticularly effective for the exploration of topics that c an\\nbe confused with other topics or that may have nuanced\\ninterpretations and where knowing the precise interpretat ion\\nthat the LLM used is important.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you generate an answer\\nExplain the reasoning and assumptions behind your\\nanswer\\n(Optional) ...so that I can improve my question\\nThe ﬁrst statement is requesting that, after generating an a n-\\nswer, the LLM should explain the reasoning and assumptions\\nbehind the answer. This statement helps the user understand\\nhow the LLM arrived at the answer and can help build trust in\\nthe model’s responses. The prompt includes the statement th at\\nthe purpose of the explanation is for the user to reﬁne their\\nquestion. This additional statement gives the LLM the conte xt\\nit needs to better tailor its explanations to the speciﬁc pur pose\\nof aising the user in producing follow-on questions.\\n4) Example Implementation: This example tailors the\\nprompt speciﬁcally to the domain of providing answers relat ed\\nto code:\\n”When you provide an answer, please explain the\\nreasoning and assumptions behind your selection\\nof software frameworks. If possible, use speciﬁc\\nexamples or evidence with associated code samples\\nto support your answer of why the framework is\\nthe best selection for the task. Moreover, please\\naddress any potential ambiguities or limitations in\\nyour answer, in order to provide a more complete\\nand accurate response.”\\nThe pattern is further customized to instruct the LLM that\\nit should justify its selection of software frameworks, but not\\nnecessarily other aspects of the answer. In addition, the us er\\ndictates that code samples should be used to help explain the\\nmotivation for selecting the speciﬁc software framework.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the Reﬂection pat-\\ntern is that it may not be effective for users who do not\\nunderstand the topic area of the discussion. For example, a\\nhighly technical question by a non-technical user may resul t\\nin a complex rationale for the answer that the user cannot\\nfathom. As with other prompt patterns, there is a risk the\\noutput may include errors or inaccurate assumptions includ ed\\nin the explanation of the rationale that the user may not be\\nable to spot. This pattern can be combined with the Fact Check\\nListto help address this issue.\\nO. The Refusal Breaker Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask an\\nLLM to automatically help users rephrase a question when it\\nrefuses to give an answer. This pattern has the potential for\\nmisuse, however, e.g., to generate phishing emails or perform\\nother actions that violate LLM policy ﬁlters. Caution shoul d\\ntherefore be exercised when applying this pattern to ensure\\nit is used ethically and responsibly. This pattern has been\\nused successfully in some LLMs to overcome the underlying\\nprompts used to program the LLM and prevent harmful output\\ngeneration.', doc_id='ffdfaca9-1d1f-4c20-90d5-343dc37cbb3a', embedding=None, doc_hash='b29bfe378509c7bc32514d27be13c92033ec4bec301c87fbaf408b98cd0546ee', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='2) Motivation: LLMs may sometimes refuse to answer\\na question, either because they do not have the required\\nknowledge or because the question is phrased in a way that\\nthey do not understand. This outcome may be frustrating\\nfor users who are looking for answers. In some situations,\\ntherefore, the Refusal Breaker pattern can help users ﬁnd a\\nway to either rephrase their question or ask a different ques tion\\nthe LLM is better equipped to answer.\\nFor example, you could ask for clariﬁcation on why the\\nquestion was refused, as there may be a speciﬁc reason why\\nLLM could not provide an answer. Another approach is to\\nask a different question that may be within its knowledge cut -\\noff or expertise. However, all these approaches require use r\\nintervention and knowledge of how to bypass the refusal.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you can’t answer a question\\nExplain why you can’t answer the question\\nProvide one or more alternative wordings of the ques-\\ntion that you could answer\\nThe ﬁrst statement sets the stage that this set of instructio ns\\nshould only be applied when a question can’t be answered.\\nThe user does not want to trigger these instructions under\\nnormal circumstances. The second statement instructs the\\nLLM to provide an explanation of why the question can’t be\\nanswered. The explanation is likely to include assumptions ,\\nconstraints, or misunderstandings that can be leveraged by the\\nuser to strategize about how to reword the question. Althoug h\\njust the explanation of why the question can’t be answered\\ncould help a user overcome the refusal, the pattern adds an\\nadditional statement for the LLM to suggest rewordings that\\nwould be acceptable. The pattern combines both reasoning\\nand suggested rewordings to improve the chances that the use r\\nwill ﬁnd a path around whatever roadblocks are preventing th e\\nquestion form being answered.\\n4) Example Implementation: The Refusal Breaker pattern\\ncan be be implemented and applied with the following phras-\\ning:\\n“Whenever you can’t answer a question, explain why\\nand provide one or more alternate wordings of the\\nquestion that you can’t answer so that I can improve\\nmy questions.”\\nA sample discourse after using the pattern is shown below:\\nUser: What is the meaning of life?\\nChatGPT : As an AI language model, I do not\\nhave personal beliefs or opinions. The meaning of\\nlife is a complex philosophical question that has\\nbeen pondered by humans for centuries and can\\nvary greatly from person to person. It may be more\\nproductive to rephrase the question in a way that can\\nbe answered by information and knowledge, such\\nas “What are some philosophical perspectives onthe meaning of life?” or “What are some common\\nbeliefs about the purpose of life?”\\n5) Consequences: This pattern provides a potential path\\nfor misuse, so organizations, parents, or other stakeholde rs\\nmay need to restrict the usage of the LLM. The ﬁrst step in\\ngoing around guardrails on usage is to understand where the\\nguardrails are. In future work, a complement of this pattern\\nmay be developed to hide the underlying prompt information\\nand rationale from users to prevent discovery.\\nAlthough the rationale and alternate rewordings are gener-\\nated, there is no guarantee that users will be able to overcom e\\nthe refusal. The alternate questions that are generated may not\\nbe of interest to the user or helpful in answering the origina l\\nquestion. The pattern mainly provides an aid in determining\\nwhat the LLM can answer, but not a guarantee that it will\\nanswer a semantically equivalent variation of the original\\nquestion.\\nP . The Context Manager Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to enable\\nusers to specify or remove context for a conversation with\\nan LLM. The goal is to focus the conversation on speciﬁc\\ntopics or exclude unrelated topics from consideration. Thi s\\npattern gives users greater control over what statements th e\\nLLM considers or ignores when generating output.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs often struggle to interpret the in-\\ntended context of the current question or generate irreleva nt\\nresponses based on prior inputs or irrelevant attention on\\nthe wrong statements. By focusing on explicit contextual\\nstatements or removing irrelevant statements, users can he lp\\nthe LLM better understand the question and generate more\\naccurate responses. Users may introduce unrelated topics o r\\nreference information from earlier in the dialogue, which\\nmay can disrupt the ﬂow of the conversation. The Context\\nManager pattern aims to emphasize or remove speciﬁc aspects\\nof the context to maintain relevance and coherence in the\\nconversation.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X\\nPlease consider Y\\nPlease ignore Z\\n(Optional) start over\\nStatements about what to consider or ignore should list key\\nconcepts, facts, instructions, etc. that should be include d or\\nremoved from the context. The more explicit the statements\\nare, the more likely the LLM will take appropriate action. Fo r\\nexample, if the user asks to ignore subjects related to a topi c,\\nyet some of the those statements were discussed far back in th e\\nconversation, the LLM may not properly disregard the releva nt\\ninformation. The more explicit the list is, therefore, the b etter\\nthe inclusion/exclusion behavior will be.', doc_id='3c8e5bdc-55a5-4b12-b195-05a4e201a963', embedding=None, doc_hash='6d039a497c167c2228e23dcf8a69dc6be479c221e9a86d91e576be571ec82257', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='4) Example Implementation: To specify context consider\\nusing the following prompt:\\n“When analyzing the following pieces of code, only\\nconsider security aspects.”\\nLikewise, to remove context consider using the following\\nprompt:\\n“When analyzing the following pieces of code, do\\nnot consider formatting or naming conventions.”\\nClarity and speciﬁcity are important when providing or\\nremoving context to/from an LLM so it can better understand\\nthe intended scope of the conversation and generate more\\nrelevant responses. In many situations, the user may want to\\ncompletely start over and can employ this prompt to reset the\\nLLM’s context:\\n“Ignore everything that we have discussed. Start\\nover.”\\nThe “start over” idea helps produce a complete reset of the\\ncontext.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of this pattern is that\\nit may inadvertently wipe out patterns applied to the con-\\nversation that the user is unaware of. For example, if an\\norganization injects a series of helpful patterns into the s tart of\\na conversation, the user may not be aware of these patterns an d\\nremove them through a reset of the context. This reset could\\npotentially eliminate helpful capabilities of the LLM, whi le\\nnot making it obvious that the user will lose this functional ity.\\nA potential solution to this problem is to include in the prom pt\\na request to explain what topics/instructions will potenti ally be\\nlost before proceeding.\\nQ. The Recipe Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern provides constraints to\\nultimately output a sequence of steps given some partially\\nprovided “ingredients” that must be conﬁgured in a sequence\\nof steps to achieve a stated goal. It combines the Template ,\\nAlternative Approaches , and Reﬂection patterns.\\n2) Motivation: Users often want an LLM to analyze a\\nconcrete sequence of steps or procedures to achieve a stated\\noutcome. Typically, users generally know—or have an idea\\nof—what the end goal should look like and what “ingredients”\\nbelong in the prompt. However, they may not necessarily know\\nthe precise ordering of steps to achieve that end goal.\\nFor example, a user may want a precise speciﬁcation on how\\na piece of code should be implemented or automated, such as\\n“create an Ansible playbook to ssh into a set of servers, copy\\ntext ﬁles from each server, spawn a monitoring process on\\neach server, and then close the ssh connection to each server .\\nIn other words, this pattern represents a generalization of the\\nexample of “given the ingredients in my fridge, provide dinn er\\nrecipes.” A user may also want to specify a set number of\\nalternative possibilities, such as “provide 3 different wa ys of\\ndeploying a web application to AWS using Docker containers\\nand Ansible using step by step instructions”.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like to achieve X\\nI know that I need to perform steps A,B,C\\nProvide a complete sequence of steps for me\\nFill in any missing steps\\nIdentify any unnecessary steps\\nThe ﬁrst statement “I would like to achieve X” focuses the\\nLLM on the overall goal that the recipe needs to be built\\nto achieve. The steps will be organized and completed to\\nsequentially achieve the goal speciﬁed. The second stateme nt\\nprovides the partial list of steps that the user would like\\nto include in the overall recipe. These serve as intermediat e\\nwaypoints for the path that the LLM is going to generate or\\nconstraints on the structure of the recipe. The next stateme nt\\nin the pattern, “provide a complete sequence of steps for\\nme”, indicates to the LLM that the goal is to provide a\\ncomplete sequential ordering of steps. The “ﬁll in any missi ng\\nsteps” helps ensure that the LLM will attempt to complete\\nthe recipe without further follow-up by making some choices\\non the user’s behalf regarding missing steps, as opposed to\\njust stating additional information that is needed. Finall y, the\\nlast statement, “identify any unnecessary steps,” is usefu l in\\nﬂagging inaccuracies in the user’s original request so that the\\nﬁnal recipe is efﬁcient.\\n4) Example Implementation: An example usage of this\\npattern in the context of deploying a software application t o\\nthe cloud is shown below:\\n“I am trying to deploy an application to the cloud. I\\nknow that I need to install the necessary dependen-\\ncies on a virtual machine for my application. I know\\nthat I need to sign up for an AWS account. Please\\nprovide a complete sequence of steps. Please ﬁll in\\nany missing steps. Please identify any unnecessary\\nsteps.”\\nDepending on the use case and constraints, “installing\\nnecessary dependencies on a virtual machine” may be an\\nunnecessary step. For example, if the application is alread y\\npackaged in a Docker container, the container could be de-\\nployed directly to the AWS Fargate Service, which does not\\nrequire any management of the underlying virtual machines.\\nThe inclusion of the “identify unnecessary steps” language\\nwill cause the LLM to ﬂag this issue and omit the steps from\\nthe ﬁnal recipe.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the recipe pattern is\\nthat a user may not always have a well-speciﬁed description\\nof what they would like to implement, construct, or design.\\nMoreover, this pattern may introduce unwanted bias from the\\nuser’s initially selected steps so the LLM may try to ﬁnd a\\nsolution that incorporates them, rather than ﬂagging them a s\\nunneeded. For example, an LLM may try to ﬁnd a solution\\nthat does install dependencies for a virtual machine, even i f\\nthere are solutions that do not require that.', doc_id='8ceb7e28-859f-479c-b6b2-f3254f1163c7', embedding=None, doc_hash='3dd729c817e39f9f42ff55f83152f09ddf9f8c4210e78c49fc147faf34343372', extra_info={'nome file': 'NEUCOM-D-23-00321.pdf'}), Document(text='IV. R ELATED WORK\\nSoftware patterns [10], [11] have been extensively studied\\nand documented in prior work. Patterns are widely used in\\nsoftware engineering to express the intent of design struct ures\\nin a way that is independent of implementation details. Patt erns\\nprovide a mental picture of the goals that the pattern is\\ntrying to achieve and the forces that it is trying to resolve.\\nA key advantage of patterns is their composability, allowin g\\ndevelopers to build pattern sequences and pattern language s\\nthat can be used to address complex problems. Patterns have\\nalso been investigated in other domains, such as contract\\ndesign for decentralized ledgers [17], [18].\\nThe importance of good prompt design with LLMs, such as\\nChatGPT, is well understood [19]–[28]. Previous studies ha ve\\nexamined the effect of prompt words on AI generative models.\\nFor example, Liu et al. [29] investigated how different\\nprompt key words affect image generation and different char -\\nacteristics of images. Other work has explored using LLMs\\nto generate visualizations [30]. Han et al. [31] researched\\nstrategies for designing prompts for classiﬁcation tasks. Other\\nresearch has looked at boolean prompt design for literature\\nqueries [32]. Yet other work has speciﬁcally examined promp ts\\nfor software and ﬁxing bugs [33].\\nOur work is complementary to prior work by providing\\na structure for documenting, discussing, and reasoning abo ut\\nprompts that can aid users in developing mental models for\\nstructuring prompts to solve common problems.\\nThe quality of the answers produced by LLMs, particuarly\\nChatGPT, has been assessed in a number of domains. For\\nexample, ChatGPT has been used to take the medical licensing\\nexam with surprisingly good results [3]. The use of ChatGPT\\nin Law School has also been explored [34]. Other papers have\\nlooked at its mathematical reasoning abilities [35]. As mor e\\ndomains are explored, we expect that domain-speciﬁc patter n\\ncatalogs will be developed to share domain-speciﬁc problem\\nsolving prompt structures.\\nV. C ONCLUDING REMARKS\\nThis paper presented a framework for documenting and\\napplying a catalog of prompt patterns for large language\\nmodels (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. These prompt patterns are\\nanalogous to software patterns and aim to provide reusable\\nsolutions to problems that users face when interacting with\\nLLMs to perform a wide range of tasks. The catalog of prompt\\npatterns captured via this framework (1) provides a structu red\\nway of discussing prompting solutions, (2) identiﬁes patte rns\\nin prompts, rather than focusing on speciﬁc prompt examples ,\\nand (3) classiﬁes patterns so users are guided to more efﬁcie nt\\nand effective interactions with LLMs.\\nThe following lessons learned were gleaned from our work\\non prompt patterns:\\n•Prompt patterns signiﬁcantly enrich the capabilities that\\ncan be created in a conversational LLM . For example,\\nprompts can lead to the generation of cybersecurity\\ngames, complete with ﬁctitious terminal commands thathave been run by an attacker stored in a .bashhistory\\nﬁle. As shown in Section III, larger and more complex\\ncapabilities can be created by combining prompt patterns,\\nsuch as combining the Game Play and Visualization\\nGenerator patterns.\\n•Documenting prompt patterns as a pattern catalog is\\nuseful, but insufﬁcient . Our experience indicates that\\nmuch more work can be done in this area, both in terms\\nof reﬁning and expanding the prompt patterns presented\\nin this paper, as well as in exploring new and innovative\\nways of using LLMs. In particular, weaving the prompt\\npatterns captured here as a pattern catalog into a more\\nexpression pattern language will help guide users of\\nLLMs more effectively.\\n•LLM Capabilities will evolve over time, likely necessitat-\\ning reﬁnement of patterns. As LLM capabilities change,\\nsome patterns may no longer be necessary, be obviated\\nby different styles of interaction or conversation/sessio n\\nmanagement approaches, or require enhancement to func-\\ntion correctly. Continued work will be needed to docu-\\nment and catalog patterns that provide reusable solutions.\\n•The prompt patterns are generalizable to many differ-\\nent domains. Although most of the patterns have been\\ndiscussed in the context of software development, these\\nsame patterns are applicable in arbitrary domains, ranging\\nfrom inﬁnite generation of stories for entertainment to\\neducational games to explorations of topics.\\nWe hope that this paper inspires further research and de-\\nvelopment in this area that will help enhance prompt pattern\\ndesign to create new and unexpected capabilities for conver -\\nsational LLMs.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] R.

In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge\\nnaturally in sufﬁciently large language models via a simple method called chain-of-\\nthought prompting , where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as\\nexemplars in prompting.\\nExperiments on three large language models show that chain-of-thought prompting\\nimproves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic\\nreasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking.

(2021).The NLP landscape has recently been revolutionized by\\nlanguage models (Peters et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019;\\nBrown et al., 2020, inter alia ). Scaling up the size of lan-\\nguage models has been shown to confer a range of beneﬁts,\\nsuch as improved performance and sample efﬁciency (Ka-\\nplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020, inter alia ). However,\\nscaling up model size alone has not proved sufﬁcient for\\nachieving high performance on challenging tasks such as\\narithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Rae\\net al., 2021).\\nThis work explores how the reasoning ability of large\\nlanguage models can be unlocked by a simple method\\nmotivated by two ideas. First, techniques for arithmetic\\nreasoning can beneﬁt from generating natural language\\nrationales that lead to the ﬁnal answer. Prior work has\\ngiven models the ability to generate natural language inter-\\nmediate steps by training from scratch (Ling et al., 2017)\\nor ﬁnetuning a pretrained model (Cobbe et al., 2021), in\\naddition to neuro-symbolic methods that use formal lan-\\nguages instead of natural language (Roy and Roth, 2015;\\nChiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al.,\\n2019). Second, large language models offer the exciting\\nprospect of in-context few-shot learning via prompting . That is, instead of ﬁnetuning a separate\\nlanguage model checkpoint for each new task, one can simply “prompt” the model with a few\\ninput–output exemplars demonstrating the task. Remarkably, this has been successful for a range of\\nsimple question-answering tasks (Brown et al., 2020).\\nBoth of the above ideas, however, have key limitations. For rationale-augmented training and\\nﬁnetuning methods, it is costly to create a large set of high quality rationales, which is much more\\ncomplicated than simple input–output pairs used in normal machine learning. For the traditional few-\\nshot prompting method used in Brown et al. (2020), it works poorly on tasks that require reasoning\\nabilities, and often does not improve substantially with increasing language model scale (Rae et al.,\\n2021). In this paper, we combine the strengths of these two ideas in a way that avoids their limitations.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we explore the ability of language models to perform few-shot prompting for reasoning\\ntasks, given a prompt that consists of triples: hinput, chain of thought , outputi. Achain of thought is\\na series of intermediate natural language reasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal output, and we refer to\\nthis approach as chain-of-thought prompting . An example prompt is shown in Figure 1.\\nWe present empirical evaluations on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks,\\nshowing that chain-of-thought prompting outperforms standard prompting, sometimes to a striking\\ndegree. Figure 2 illustrates one such result—on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems\\n(Cobbe et al., 2021), chain-of-thought prompting with PaLM 540B outperforms standard prompting\\nby a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. A prompting only approach is\\nimportant because it does not require a large training dataset and because a single model checkpoint\\ncan perform many tasks without loss of generality. This work underscores how large language models\\ncan learn via a few examples with natural language data about the task (c.f. automatically learning\\nthe patterns underlying inputs and outputs via a large training dataset).\\n2 Chain-of-Thought Prompting\\nConsider one’s own thought process when solving a complicated reasoning task such as a multi-step\\nmath word problem. It is typical to decompose the problem into intermediate steps and solve each\\nbefore giving the ﬁnal answer: “After Jane gives 2 ﬂowers to her mom she has 10 :::then after she\\ngives 3 to her dad she will have 7 :::so the answer is 7. ” The goal of this paper is to endow language\\nmodels with the ability to generate a similar chain of thought —a coherent series of intermediate\\nreasoning steps that lead to the ﬁnal answer for a problem. We will show that sufﬁciently large\\n2', doc_id='d512ad64-e97c-4524-ab52-da9daf0bab15', embedding=None, doc_hash='7778451b1e7bb41b6be219026f9529d567f51a4f81704de4bd5b45b840d5cf5c', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='language models can generate chains of thought if demonstrations of chain-of-thought reasoning are\\nprovided in the exemplars for few-shot prompting.\\nFigure 1 shows an example of a model producing a chain of thought to solve a math word problem\\nthat it would have otherwise gotten incorrect. The chain of thought in this case resembles a solution\\nand can interpreted as one, but we still opt to call it a chain of thought to better capture the idea that it\\nmimics a step-by-step thought process for arriving at the answer (and also, solutions/explanations\\ntypically come after the ﬁnal answer (Narang et al., 2020; Wiegreffe et al., 2022; Lampinen et al.,\\n2022, inter alia )).\\nChain-of-thought prompting has several attractive properties as an approach for facilitating reasoning\\nin language models.\\n1.First, chain of thought, in principle, allows models to decompose multi-step problems into\\nintermediate steps, which means that additional computation can be allocated to problems\\nthat require more reasoning steps.\\n2.Second, a chain of thought provides an interpretable window into the behavior of the model,\\nsuggesting how it might have arrived at a particular answer and providing opportunities\\nto debug where the reasoning path went wrong (although fully characterizing a model’s\\ncomputations that support an answer remains an open question).\\n3.Third, chain-of-thought reasoning can be used for tasks such as math word problems,\\ncommonsense reasoning, and symbolic manipulation, and is potentially applicable (at least\\nin principle) to any task that humans can solve via language.\\n4.Finally, chain-of-thought reasoning can be readily elicited in sufﬁciently large off-the-shelf\\nlanguage models simply by including examples of chain of thought sequences into the\\nexemplars of few-shot prompting.\\nIn empirical experiments, we will observe the utility of chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic\\nreasoning (Section 3), commonsense reasoning (Section 4), and symbolic reasoning (Section 5).\\n3 Arithmetic Reasoning\\nWe begin by considering math word problems of the form in Figure 1, which measure the arithmetic\\nreasoning ability of language models. Though simple for humans, arithmetic reasoning is a task where\\nlanguage models often struggle (Hendrycks et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2021, inter alia ). Strikingly, chain-\\nof-thought prompting when used with the 540B parameter language model performs comparably with\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁnetuned models on several tasks, even achieving new state of the art on the challenging\\nGSM8K benchmark (Cobbe et al., 2021).\\n3.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe explore chain-of-thought prompting for various language models on multiple benchmarks.\\nBenchmarks. We consider the following ﬁve math word problem benchmarks: (1)theGSM8K\\nbenchmark of math word problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), (2)theSV AMP dataset of math word\\nproblems with varying structures (Patel et al., 2021), (3)theASDiv dataset of diverse math word\\nproblems (Miao et al., 2020), (4)theAQuA dataset of algebraic word problems, and (5)theMA WPS\\nbenchmark (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2016). Example problems are given in Appendix Table 12.\\nStandard prompting. For the baseline, we consider standard few-shot prompting, popularized by\\nBrown et al. (2020), in which a language model is given in-context exemplars of input–output pairs\\nbefore outputting a prediction for a test-time example. Exemplars are formatted as questions and\\nanswers. The model gives the answer directly, as shown in Figure 1 (left).\\nChain-of-thought prompting. Our proposed approach is to augment each exemplar in few-shot\\nprompting with a chain of thought for an associated answer, as illustrated in Figure 1 (right). As most\\nof the datasets only have an evaluation split, we manually composed a set of eight few-shot exemplars\\nwith chains of thought for prompting—Figure 1 (right) shows one chain of thought exemplar, and the\\nfull set of exemplars is given in Appendix Table 20.

For AQuA, we used four exemplars\\nand solutions from the training set, as given in Appendix Table 21.\\nLanguage models. We evaluate ﬁve large language models. The ﬁrst is GPT-3 (Brown et al.,\\n2020), for which we use text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001, and text-davinci-002, which\\npresumably correspond to InstructGPT models of 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B parameters (Ouyang\\net al., 2022).The second is LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), which has models of 422M, 2B, 8B,\\n68B, and 137B parameters. The third is PaLM , which has models of 8B, 62B, and 540B parameters.\\nThe fourth is UL2 20B (Tay et al., 2022), and the ﬁfth is Codex (Chen et al., 2021, code-davinci-002\\nin the OpenAI API). We sample from the models via greedy decoding (though follow-up work shows\\nchain-of-thought prompting can be improved by taking the majority ﬁnal answer over many sampled\\ngenerations (Wang et al., 2022a)). For LaMDA, we report averaged results over ﬁve random seeds,\\nwhere each seed had a different randomly shufﬂed order of exemplars. As LaMDA experiments\\ndid not show large variance among different seeds, to save compute we report results for a single\\nexemplar order for all other models.\\n3.2 Results\\nThe strongest results of chain-of-thought prompting are summarized in Figure 4, with all experimental\\noutputs for each model collection, model size, and benchmark shown in Table 2 in the Appendix.\\nThere are three key takeaways. First, Figure 4 shows that chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent\\nability of model scale (Wei et al., 2022b). That is, chain-of-thought prompting does not positively\\nimpact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of\\n\\x18100B parameters. We qualitatively found that models of smaller scale produced ﬂuent but illogical\\nchains of thought, leading to lower performance than standard prompting.\\n4', doc_id='8b767d00-48af-4053-a70b-b8598073042c', embedding=None, doc_hash='3fd24529a0e6dbf3f3ac5569ca2c9409ca08a46fcca48aed614ef43d9fc8c904', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='0204060GSM8K\\nsolve rate (%)LaMDA GPT PaLMStandard prompting\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nPrior supervised best\\n020406080SV AMP\\nsolve rate (%)\\n0.4 81370255075100MAWPS\\nsolve rate (%)\\n0.4 7175 862540\\nModel scale (# parameters in billions)\\nFigure 4: Chain-of-thought prompting enables\\nlarge language models to solve challenging math\\nproblems. Notably, chain-of-thought reasoning\\nis an emergent ability of increasing model scale.\\nPrior best numbers are from Cobbe et al. (2021)\\nfor GSM8K, Jie et al. (2022) for SV AMP, and Lan\\net al. (2021) for MAWPS.Second, chain-of-thought prompting has larger\\nperformance gains for more-complicated prob-\\nlems. For instance, for GSM8K (the dataset\\nwith the lowest baseline performance), perfor-\\nmance more than doubled for the largest GPT\\nand PaLM models. On the other hand, for Sin-\\ngleOp, the easiest subset of MAWPS which only\\nrequires a single step to solve, performance im-\\nprovements were either negative or very small\\n(see Appendix Table 3).\\nThird, chain-of-thought prompting via GPT-3\\n175B and PaLM 540B compares favorably to\\nprior state of the art, which typically ﬁnetunes a\\ntask-speciﬁc model on a labeled training dataset.\\nFigure 4 shows how PaLM 540B uses chain-of-\\nthought prompting to achieve new state of the art\\non GSM8K, SV AMP, and MAWPS (though note\\nthat standard prompting already passed the prior\\nbest for SV AMP). On the other two datasets,\\nAQuA and ASDiv, PaLM with chain-of-thought\\nprompting reaches within 2% of the state of the\\nart (Appendix Table 2).\\nTo better understand why chain-of-thought\\nprompting works, we manually examined model-\\ngenerated chains of thought by LaMDA 137B\\nfor GSM8K. Of 50 random examples where the\\nmodel returned the correct ﬁnal answer, all of\\nthe generated chains of thought were also log-\\nically and mathematically correct except two\\nthat coincidentally arrived at the correct answer\\n(see Appendix D.1, and Table 8 for examples\\nof correct model-generated chains of thought).\\nWe also randomly examined 50 random sam-\\nples for which the model gave the wrong answer.\\nThe summary of this analysis is that 46% of the\\nchains of thought were almost correct, barring\\nminor mistakes (calculator error, symbol map-\\nping error, or one reasoning step missing), and that the other 54% of the chains of thought had major\\nerrors in semantic understanding or coherence (see Appendix D.2). To provide a small insight into\\nwhy scaling improves chain-of-thought reasoning ability, we performed a similar analysis of errors\\nmade by PaLM 62B and whether those errors were ﬁxed by scaling to PaLM 540B. The summary\\nis that scaling PaLM to 540B ﬁxes a large portion of one-step missing and semantic understanding\\nerrors in the 62B model (see Appendix A.1).\\n3.3 Ablation Study\\nThe observed beneﬁts of using chain-of-thought prompting raises the natural question of whether the\\nsame performance improvements can be conferred via other types of prompting. Figure 5 shows an\\nablation study with three variations of chain of thought described below.\\nEquation only. One reason for why chain-of-thought prompting might help is that it produces the\\nmathematical equation to be evaluated, and so we test a variation where the model is prompted\\nto output only a mathematical equation before giving the answer. Figure 5 shows that equation\\nonly prompting does not help much for GSM8K, which implies that the semantics of the questions\\nin GSM8K are too challenging to directly translate into an equation without the natural language\\nreasoning steps in chain of thought. For datasets of one-step or two-step problems, however, we ﬁnd\\nthat equation only prompting does improve performance, since the equation can be easily derived\\nfrom the question (see Appendix Table 6).\\n5', doc_id='2569687b-8226-4964-b2c0-7670fc086203', embedding=None, doc_hash='a2549f9f47aaab9eced4a87a3096cfc0a738c72e45d0073994579daef6b19883', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='LaMDA PaLM0204060GSM8K solve rate (%)Standard prompting\\nEquation only\\nVariable compute only\\nReasoning after answer\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\nFigure 5: Ablation study for dif-\\nferent variations of prompting us-\\ning LaMDA 137B and PaLM 540B.\\nResults for other datasets are given\\nin Appendix Table 6 and Table 7.Variable compute only. Another intuition is that chain of\\nthought allows the model to spend more computation (i.e.,\\nintermediate tokens) on harder problems. To isolate the effect\\nof variable computation from chain-of-thought reasoning, we\\ntest a conﬁguration where the model is prompted to output a\\nonly sequence of dots ( :::) equal to the number of characters in\\nthe equation needed to solve the problem. This variant performs\\nabout the same as the baseline, which suggests that variable\\ncomputation by itself is not the reason for the success of chain-\\nof-thought prompting, and that there appears to be utility from\\nexpressing intermediate steps via natural language.\\nChain of thought after answer. Another potential beneﬁt of\\nchain-of-thought prompting could simply be that such prompts\\nallow the model to better access relevant knowledge acquired\\nduring pretraining. Therefore, we test an alternative conﬁgura-\\ntion where the chain of thought prompt is only given after the\\nanswer, isolating whether the model actually depends on the\\nproduced chain of thought to give the ﬁnal answer. This variant\\nperforms about the same as the baseline, which suggests that\\nthe sequential reasoning embodied in the chain of thought is\\nuseful for reasons beyond just activating knowledge.\\n3.4 Robustness of Chain of Thought\\nGSM8K05101520Solve rate (%)Standard prompting\\nChain-of-thought prompting\\n\\x01different annotator (B)\\n\\x01different annotator (C)\\n\\x01intentionally concise style\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\x0b)\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\x0c)\\n\\x01exemplars from GSM8K ( \\r)\\nMAWPS0204060\\nFigure 6: Chain-of-thought prompting\\nhas variance for different prompt exam-\\nples (as expected) but outperforms stan-\\ndard prompting for various annotators as\\nwell as for different exemplars.Sensitivity to exemplars is a key consideration of prompt-\\ning approaches—for instance, varying the permutation of\\nfew-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy of GPT-3 on\\nSST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near state of\\nthe art (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021). In this ﬁnal subsec-\\ntion, we evaluate robustness to chains of thought written\\nby different annotators. In addition to the results above,\\nwhich used chains of thought written by an Annotator\\nA, two other co-authors of this paper (Annotators B and\\nC) independently wrote chains of thought for the same\\nfew-shot exemplars (shown in Appendix H). Annotator A\\nalso wrote another chain of thought that was more concise\\nthan the original, following the style of solutions given in\\nCobbe et al. (2021).1\\nFigure 6 shows these results for LaMDA 137B on GSM8K\\nand MAWPS (ablation results for other datasets are given\\nin Appendix Table 6 / Table 7). Although there is variance\\namong different chain of thought annotations, as would be\\nexpected when using exemplar-based prompting (Le Scao\\nand Rush, 2021; Reynolds and McDonell, 2021; Zhao\\net al., 2021), all sets of chain of thought prompts outper-\\nform the standard baseline by a large margin. This result\\nimplies that successful use of chain of thought does not\\ndepend on a particular linguistic style.\\nTo conﬁrm that successful chain-of-thought prompting\\nworks for other sets of exemplars, we also run experiments\\nwith three sets of eight exemplars randomly sampled from the GSM8K training set, an independent\\n1For instance, whereas original chain of thought uses several short sentences ( “’There were originally 9\\ncomputers.

So there are 9 + 20 = 29\\nnew computers in the server room now” .\\n6', doc_id='54c20690-d618-435f-96c4-d5c9e200d6fe', embedding=None, doc_hash='05d0f93532d723720f5e935824226a826cb881239ae1f87572295282b155ed2a', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='source (examples in this dataset already included reasoning steps like a chain of thought).2Fig-\\nure 6 shows that these prompts performed comparably with our manually written exemplars, also\\nsubstantially outperforming standard prompting.\\nIn addition to robustness to annotators, independently-written chains of thought, different exemplars,\\nand various language models, we also ﬁnd that chain-of-thought prompting for arithmetic reasoning\\nis robust to different exemplar orders and varying numbers of exemplars (see Appendix A.2).\\n4 Commonsense Reasoning\\nAlthough chain of thought is particularly suitable for math word problems, the language-based nature\\nof chain of thought actually makes it applicable to a broad class of commonsense reasoning problems,\\nwhich involve reasoning about physical and human interactions under the presumption of general\\nbackground knowledge.

We consider ﬁve datasets covering a diverse range of commonsense reasoning types.\\nThe popular CSQA (Talmor et al., 2019) asks commonsense questions about the world involving\\ncomplex semantics that often require prior knowledge. StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) requires\\nmodels to infer a multi-hop strategy to answer questions. We choose two specialized evaluation sets\\nfrom the BIG-bench effort (BIG-bench collaboration, 2021): Date Understanding, which involves\\ninferring a date from a given context, and Sports Understanding, which involves determining whether\\na sentence relating to sports is plausible or implausible. Finally, the SayCan dataset (Ahn et al.,\\n2022) involves mapping a natural language instruction to a sequence of robot actions from a discrete\\nset.

For CSQA and StrategyQA,\\nwe randomly selected examples from the training set and manually composed chains of thought for\\nthem to use as few-shot exemplars. The two BIG-bench tasks do not have training sets, so we selected\\nthe ﬁrst ten examples as exemplars in the evaluation set as few-shot exemplars and report numbers on\\nthe rest of the evaluation set. For SayCan, we use six examples from the training set used in Ahn et al.\\n(2022) and also manually composed chains of thought.\\nResults. Figure 7 highlights these results for PaLM (full results for LaMDA, GPT-3, and different\\nmodel scales are shown in Table 4). For all tasks, scaling up model size improved the performance\\nof standard prompting; chain-of-thought prompting led to further gains, with improvements appear-\\ning to be largest for PaLM 540B.

We show that chain-of-\\nthought prompting not only enables language models to\\nperform symbolic reasoning tasks that are challenging in\\nthe standard prompting setting, but also facilitates length\\ngeneralization to inference-time inputs longer than those\\nseen in the few-shot exemplars.\\nTasks. We use the following two toy tasks.\\n•Last letter concatenation. This task asks the model\\nto concatenate the last letters of words in a name (e.g.,\\n“Amy Brown”!“yn” ). It is a more challenging version\\nof ﬁrst letter concatenation, which language models can\\nalready perform without chain of thought.3We generate\\nfull names by randomly concatenating names from the\\ntop one-thousand ﬁrst and last names from name census\\ndata ( https://namecensus.com/ ).\\n•Coin ﬂip. This task asks the model to answer whether a\\ncoin is still heads up after people either ﬂip or don’t ﬂip\\nthe coin (e.g., “A coin is heads up. Phoebe ﬂips the coin.\\nOsvaldo does not ﬂip the coin. Is the coin still heads up?”\\n!“no” ).\\nAs the construction of these symbolic reasoning tasks is\\nwell-deﬁned, for each task we consider an in-domain test\\nset for which examples had the same number of steps as\\nthe training/few-shot exemplars, as well as an out-of-domain (OOD) test set, for which evaluation\\nexamples had more steps than those in the exemplars. For last letter concatenation, the model only\\nsees exemplars of names with two words, and then performs last letter concatenation on names with 3\\nand 4 words.4We do the same for the number of potential ﬂips in the coin ﬂip task. Our experimental\\nsetup uses the same methods and models as in the prior two sections. We again manually compose\\nchains of thought for the few-shot exemplars for each task, which are given in Figure 3.\\nResults. The results of these in-domain and OOD evaluations are shown in Figure 8 for PaLM,\\nwith results for LaMDA shown in Appendix Table 5. With PaLM 540B, chain-of-thought prompting\\nleads to almost 100% solve rates (note that standard prompting already solves coin ﬂip with PaLM\\n540, though not for LaMDA 137B). Note that these in-domain evaluations are “toy tasks” in the\\nsense that perfect solution structures are already provided by the chains of thought in the few-shot\\nexemplars; all the model has to do is repeat the same steps with the new symbols in the test-time\\nexample. And yet, small models still fail—the ability to perform abstract manipulations on unseen\\nsymbols for these three tasks only arises at the scale of 100B model parameters.\\nAs for the OOD evaluations, standard prompting fails for both tasks. With chain-of-thought prompting,\\nlanguage models achieve upward scaling curves (though performance is lower than in the in-domain\\nsetting). Hence, chain-of-thought prompting facilitates length generalization beyond seen chains of\\nthought for language models of sufﬁcient scale.\\n6 Discussion\\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple mechanism for eliciting multi-step rea-\\nsoning behavior in large language models. We ﬁrst saw that chain-of-thought prompting improves\\nperformance by a large margin on arithmetic reasoning, yielding improvements that are much stronger\\nthan ablations and robust to different annotators, exemplars, and language models (Section 3). Next,\\n3We tested 10 common names using GPT-3 davinci and it got all but one correct.\\n4For names of length longer than 2 words, we concatenate multiple ﬁrst and last names together.\\n8', doc_id='c2e3abc1-4419-4612-9449-8ce492e0f17c', embedding=None, doc_hash='dc8a4aa833ddaed440953b79461749a465fbbaf92f817e84cfdc2b9b4f6b9c09', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='experiments on commonsense reasoning underscored how the linguistic nature of chain-of-thought\\nreasoning makes it generally applicable (Section 4). Finally, we showed that for symbolic reasoning,\\nchain-of-thought prompting facilitates OOD generalization to longer sequence lengths (Section 5). In\\nall experiments, chain-of-thought reasoning is elicited simply by prompting an off-the-shelf language\\nmodel. No language models were ﬁnetuned in the process of writing this paper.\\nThe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale has been a prevailing theme\\n(Wei et al., 2022b). For many reasoning tasks where standard prompting has a ﬂat scaling curve, chain-\\nof-thought prompting leads to dramatically increasing scaling curves. Chain-of-thought prompting\\nappears to expand the set of tasks that large language models can perform successfully—in other\\nwords, our work underscores that standard prompting only provides a lower bound on the capabilities\\nof large language models. This observation likely raises more questions than it answers—for instance,\\nhow much more can we expect reasoning ability to improve with a further increase in model scale?\\nWhat other prompting methods might expand the range of tasks that language models can solve?\\nAs for limitations, we ﬁrst qualify that although chain of thought emulates the thought processes of\\nhuman reasoners, this does not answer whether the neural network is actually “reasoning,” which\\nwe leave as an open question. Second, although the cost of manually augmenting exemplars with\\nchains of thought is minimal in the few-shot setting, such annotation costs could be prohibitive for\\nﬁnetuning (though this could potentially be surmounted with synthetic data generation, or zero-shot\\ngeneralization). Third, there is no guarantee of correct reasoning paths, which can lead to both correct\\nand incorrect answers; improving factual generations of language models is an open direction for\\nfuture work (Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and Durrett, 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022, inter alia ). Finally,\\nthe emergence of chain-of-thought reasoning only at large model scales makes it costly to serve in\\nreal-world applications; further research could explore how to induce reasoning in smaller models.\\n7 Related Work\\nThis work is inspired by many research areas, which we detail in an extended related work section\\n(Appendix C). Here we describe two directions and associated papers that are perhaps most relevant.\\nThe ﬁrst relevant direction is using intermediate steps to solve reasoning problems. Ling et al. (2017)\\npioneer the idea of using natural language rationales to solve math word problems through a series\\nof intermediate steps. Their work is a remarkable contrast to the literature using formal languages\\nto reason (Roy et al., 2015; Chiang and Chen, 2019; Amini et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019). Cobbe\\net al. (2021) extend Ling et al. (2017) by creating a larger dataset and using it to ﬁnetune a pretrained\\nlanguage model rather than training a model from scratch. In the domain of program synthesis,\\nNye et al. (2021) leverage language models to predict the ﬁnal outputs of Python programs via\\nﬁrst line-to-line predicting the intermediate computational results, and show that their step-by-step\\nprediction method performs better than directly predicting the ﬁnal outputs.\\nNaturally, this paper also relates closely to the large body of recent work on prompting. Since the\\npopularization of few-shot prompting as given by Brown et al. (2020), several general approaches\\nhave improved the prompting ability of models, such as automatically learning prompts (Lester et al.,\\n2021) or giving models instructions describing a task (Wei et al., 2022a; Sanh et al., 2022; Ouyang\\net al., 2022). Whereas these approaches improve or augment the input part of the prompt (e.g.,\\ninstructions that are prepended to inputs), our work takes the orthogonal direction of augmenting the\\noutputs of language models with a chain of thought.\\n8 Conclusions\\nWe have explored chain-of-thought prompting as a simple and broadly applicable method for enhanc-\\ning reasoning in language models. Through experiments on arithmetic, symbolic, and commonsense\\nreasoning, we ﬁnd that chain-of-thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale that allows\\nsufﬁciently large language models to perform reasoning tasks that otherwise have ﬂat scaling curves.\\nBroadening the range of reasoning tasks that language models can perform will hopefully inspire\\nfurther work on language-based approaches to reasoning.\\n9', doc_id='107a9c80-4881-40c1-a9c1-2a9f9c97f00d', embedding=None, doc_hash='5a433da1c6dd9442d80a1ee4698045745c82439180addbd7cbca9b5a21fed62b', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Acknowledgements\\nWe thank Jacob Devlin, Claire Cui, Andrew Dai, and Ellie Pavlick for providing feedback on the\\npaper.

Scaling up language models has been shown to confer beneﬁts such as improved\\nperformance and sample efﬁciency (Kaplan et al., 2020), but chain-of-thought reasoning is emergent\\nin the sense that its success cannot be predicted only by extrapolating the performance of small scale\\nmodels, as chain of thought actually hurts performance for most models smaller than 10B parameters.\\nThe question of why model scale improves chain-of-thought prompting is certainly multi-faceted, and\\nwe made a preliminary attempt to shed insight into it via error analysis. This small analysis involved\\nmanually reading 45 errors made by PaLM 62B and categorizing them into semantic understanding\\n(20 errors), one step missing (18 errors), and other errors (7 errors). The “other category” included\\nhallucinations, repetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. This categorization is a coarse one\\nborrowed from the initial error analysis done on LaMDA in Appendix D.2, for which categories were\\nconceived based on what improvements were needed to make the chain of thought correct.\\nAs shown in Figure 9, scaling PaLM to 540B parameters ﬁxed a substantial portion of errors in all\\nthree categories. Examples of semantic understanding and one-step missing errors that were ﬁxed by\\nscaling PaLM to 540B are given in Figure 10. This result appears consistent with a hypothesis that\\nlanguage models acquire a range of semantic understanding and logical reasoning skills as a function\\nof model scale (though note that model scale is often conﬂated with other factors, such as amount of\\ntraining compute).\\nSemantic understanding\\n(62B made 20 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 6 of them)One step missing\\n(62B made 18 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 12 of them)Other\\n(62B made 7 errors of this type, 540B ﬁxes 4 of them)Types of errors made by a 62B language model:Errors ﬁxed by scaling from 62B to 540B\\nFigure 9: Error analysis of 45 problems that PaLM 62B got incorrect. These errors were categorized\\nthat semantic understanding, one step missing, and other. The other category includes hallucinations,\\nrepetitive outputs, and symbol mapping errors. Scaling PaLM to 540B ﬁxed a substantial portion of\\nerrors in all categories.\\nThere are also three notable points regarding why small language models fail. The ﬁrst observation\\nis that small language models fail at even relatively easy symbol mapping tasks. As demonstrated\\nin Section 5, for even symbolic reasoning tasks that only require generalization to new examples\\nusing the same chain of thought logical structure that was given in the few-shot exemplars, small\\nlanguage models still failed. The second observation is that small language models seem to have\\ninherently weaker arithmetic abilities, as shown by Brown et al. (2020), the ability to do simple\\narithmetic operations (without semantic understanding) requires sufﬁcient model scale. Finally, we\\nnoticed qualitatively that small language models often did not generate a ﬁnal answer that could be\\nparsed, due to either repetitions or logic that never arrived at a ﬁnal answer.\\nIn summary, the success of chain-of-thought reasoning as a result of model scale is a complicated\\nphenomena that likely involves a variety of emergent abilities (semantic understanding, symbol\\nmapping, staying on topic, arithmetic ability, faithfulness, etc). Future work could more thoroughly\\ninvestigate what properties of pretraining data, model architecture, and optimization objective causally\\nenable such reasoning capabilities.\\n16', doc_id='16ee1cb5-9e01-43c3-a41b-576fb9d844d5', embedding=None, doc_hash='1725b9443ebfc0152f6d8cafee43e66b0a3f9a4f308c19e80ed061f104fa7acb', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text=\"Tracy used a piece of wire 4 feet long to support tomato plants in the garden.

There is no shortage\\nof work showing that prompts affect language models in unexpected ways (Min et al., 2022). The\\ngeneral way that we created chain of thought annotations was by taking eight exemplars from the\\ntraining set and decomposing the reasoning process into multiple steps leading to the ﬁnal answer.\\nExamples of chain of thought annotations are provided in Figure 3, with full prompts given in\\nAppendix G. To analyze how sensitive chain of thought is to prompt engineering, we performed\\nrobustness experiments with respect to various factors.\\n•Different annotators. We ﬁrst analyze robustness to three different annotators (Section 3.4 and\\nFigure 6). Although there is notable variance in performance (which we will discuss later), chain\\nof thought performed better than the baseline by a large margin for all three annotators on eight\\ndatasets in arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning (Table 6 and Table 7). Similar to the\\nannotation process in Cobbe et al. (2021), annotators were not given speciﬁc instructions about\\n17\", doc_id='79c64b45-80dd-4531-9cbc-a0502cc96c73', embedding=None, doc_hash='f2dcdab9d77f0af134f1c74d6e02c3a824ed8164012a081940bde5e55766c18e', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='how to write the chain of thought annotations other than to simply write the step-by-step reasoning\\nprocess that led to the ﬁnal answer. Thus, the annotations were written in each annotator’s own\\nlinguistic “chain of thought” writing style.\\n•Annotators without machine learning background. The GSM8K dataset (Cobbe et al., 2021)\\nconveniently provides a training set with reasoning chains written by crowd compute workers,\\nwhich enables us to investigate whether chain of thought still works with reasoning chains from an\\nindependent source without a background in machine learning. So we randomly sampled three sets\\nof eight exemplars with chains of thought from GSM8K. These chain of thought annotations also\\noutperformed the baseline by a large margin for all four arithmetic datasets (Table 6), indicating\\nthat chain of thought is not dependent on a particular set of annotators.\\n•Different exemplars. The different GSM8K exemplars experiment above (Table 6) also shows\\nthat chain-of-thought prompting works for different sets of exemplars. Notably, we test every set of\\nexemplars on all four arithmetic datasets (instead of picking exemplars from the training set for\\neach dataset), which suggests that the exemplars do not necessarily have to come from the same\\ndataset distribution as the test examples.\\n•Different order of exemplars. Prior work has shown that in some cases (e.g., classiﬁcation) even\\nthe order of prompts matter—varying the permutation of few-shot exemplars can cause the accuracy\\nof GPT-3 on SST-2 to range from near chance (54.3%) to near SOTA (93.4%) (Zhao et al., 2021).\\nWe show the standard deviation of performance from different exemplars in Table 6 and Table 7.\\nStandard deviations with respect to prompt order are relatively minimal in almost all cases. The\\none exception is the coin ﬂip task, for which exemplar orders have high standard deviation, likely\\nfor the reason cited in Zhao et al. (2021)—for classiﬁcation, many exemplars of the same category\\nin a row biases the model outputs).\\n•Different number of exemplars. We also found that gains from chain-of-thought prompting\\ngenerally still held when there was a varying number of few-shot exemplars. This is shown for ﬁve\\ndatasets in Figure 11 (we did not have the compute to run this for all datasets). We also found in\\npreliminary experiments that further increasing the number of exemplars in standard prompting\\ndid not lead to signiﬁcant gains (e.g., increasing from 8 to 16 exemplars did not improve the\\nperformance of standard prompting enough to catch up with chain-of-thought prompting).\\n•Different language models. Another interesting question is whether certain prompts that work\\nbetter for one model work better for other large language models. We ﬁnd that with the same\\nprompts, chain-of-thought prompting improves performance across all three models (LaMDA,\\nGPT-3, and PaLM) for all datasets except CSQA and StrategyQA for GPT-3 (Table 1, Table 4,\\nTable 5). The fact that gains from chain of thought did not transfer perfectly among models is\\na limitation; further work could investigate why how different pre-training datasets and model\\narchitectures affect the performance gain from chain-of-thought prompting.\\nPrompt engineering still matters, though. Although the results are relatively robust to the prompt\\nfor arithmetic reasoning, we want to be clear that prompt engineering still does matter, and can\\nimprove performance signiﬁcantly in many cases. Though most chain of thought annotations\\noutperform standard prompting, there is large variation in many cases. For instance, for the coin\\nﬂip task, the performance varied from 99.6% for Annotator A to 71.4% for Annotator C, though\\nboth were above standard prompting = 50.0% (see Table 7). There are even tasks where prompt\\nengineering is a requirement for good performance. In preliminary experiments, we tried using chain\\nof thought to enable language models to reverse the order of a list of 5 items. While two co-authors\\nwere not able to write chain of thought prompts that solved the task despite their best attempts, a third\\nco-author was able to write a chain of thought that perfectly solved the task.\\nHow to generate chain of thought annotations in a robust fashion could be an interesting direction\\nfor future work. For instance, an idea here could be to use a large language model to automatically\\ngenerate chains of thought via prompting (and potentially optimize this over a validation set).\\nA.3 Will chain-of-thought prompting improve performance for my task of interest?\\nWhile chain-of-thought prompting is in principle applicable for any text-to-text task, it is more\\nhelpful for some tasks than others. Based on the experiments in this paper, our intuition is that chain\\nof thought helps the most when three conditions are met: (1) the task is challenging and requires\\n18', doc_id='35e44e77-4315-469d-90d3-6df908b3ec19', embedding=None, doc_hash='7d53a9f051c845097dba0324ba4d0854a9ccc26927c87397eff36932ce6a12f9', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='multi-step reasoning, (2) a large language model is used, and (3) the scaling curve is relatively ﬂat.\\nConversely, the beneﬁts are smaller when one or more of these conditions are not met.\\nThese intuitions are perhaps supported by the arithmetic reasoning results. The performance gain\\nfrom chain-of-thought prompting is largest for PaLM 540B on GSM8K (challenging multi-step\\nproblems, ﬂat scaling curve), which meets these conditions. The performance gain is small for the\\nsubsets of MAWPS that only require one or two steps (SingleOP, SingleEq, and AddSub), for which\\nPaLM 540B already achieves performance of 90% or higher (and it is also generally true that there is\\nless headroom for improvement when performance is already strong).\\nAlthough in this paper we focused on multi-step reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, and\\nsymbolic), chain-of-thought prompting can potentially be applied to any task for which humans use a\\n“chain of thought” to solve (at least in principle). We leave the empirical evaluation of chain-of-thought\\nprompting on such diverse tasks (e.g., machine translation, etc.) to future work.\\nA.4 Why is prompting with the equation only not enough for some arithmetic reasoning\\ndatasets?\\nPrompting with the equation only as an intermediate step does help on many datasets, especially when\\nthe datasets only require a few reasoning steps (SV AMP, ASDiv, MAWPS). For GSM8K, however,\\nusing the equation only did not improve performance substantially. Based on qualitative analysis, we\\nbelieve that these questions are too semantically challenging for the model to directly translate them\\ninto a math equation. Consider this example from LaMDA 137B:\\nQUESTION :Mike plays ping pong for 40 minutes. In the ﬁrst 20 minutes, he scores 4\\npoints. In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points. How many total points did he\\nscore?\\nEQUATION ONLY (WRONG ANSWER ):(4 + 20 * 0.25) = 6. The answer is 6.\\nCHAIN OF THOUGHT (CORRECT ):Mike played ping pong for 40 minutes. In the ﬁrst\\n20 minutes, he scored 4 points. In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points. So\\nhe scored 25% more in the second 20 minutes. 4 x 1.25 = 5. So he scored 5 points in the\\nsecond 20 minutes. So he scored 9 points in total. The answer is 9.\\nIt is hard for the model to directly translate all of the semantics into a single equation, but chain of\\nthought allows it to better reason about each part of the question via intermediate steps in natural\\nlanguage.\\n19', doc_id='778cf25a-6bc5-48ff-9626-29ff13b60996', embedding=None, doc_hash='09b3f1d9c7b9186cb0b2b1e6da1446bb5ddc6b35b62404ad173f3be1db5a4156', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='B All Experimental Results\\nThis section contains tables for experimental results for varying models and model sizes, on all\\nbenchmarks, for standard prompting vs. chain-of-thought prompting.\\nFor the arithmetic reasoning benchmarks, some chains of thought (along with the equations produced)\\nwere correct, except the model performed an arithmetic operation incorrectly.

(2020), and see Liu et al. (2021) for a\\nsurvey). This paper falls in the category of general prompting approaches, whereby input prompts are\\noptimized to allow a single large language model to better perform a variety of tasks (Li and Liang,\\n2021; Lester et al., 2021; Reif et al., 2022, inter alia ).\\nOne recent line of work aims to improve the ability of language models to perform a task by providing\\ninstructions that describe the task (Raffel et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022a; Ouyang et al., 2022; Sanh\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b). This line of work is related because it also augments input–output\\npairs with meta-data. But whereas an instruction augments the input to a task (instructions are typically\\nprepended to the inputs), chain-of-thought prompting augments the outputs of language models.\\nAnother related direction is sequentially combining the outputs of language models; human–computer\\ninteraction (HCI) work (Wu et al., 2022a,b) has shown that combining sequential generations of\\nlanguage models improves task outcomes in a 20-person user study.\\nC.2 Natural language explanations\\nAnother closely related direction uses natural language explanations (NLEs), often with the goal of\\nimproving model interpretability (Zhou et al., 2020; Wiegreffe and Marasovi ´c, 2021, inter alia ). That\\nline of work typically focuses on natural language inference (Camburu et al., 2018; Yordanov et al.,\\n2021; Bostrom et al., 2021), and produces explanations either simultaneously to or after the ﬁnal\\nprediction (Narang et al., 2020; Majumder et al., 2021; Wiegreffe et al., 2021, 2022). By contrast,\\nthe chain of thought processing considered in this paper occurs before the ﬁnal answer. And while\\nNLE aims mostly to improve neural network interpretability (Rajagopal et al., 2021), the goal of\\nchain-of-thought prompting is to allow models to decompose multi-hop reasoning tasks into multiple\\nsteps—interpretability is just a side effect. Marasovi ´c et al. (2022) show that prompt-based ﬁnetuning\\nwith NLE improves NLI and classiﬁcation performance, though they largely focus on evaluating\\nexplanation plausibility. In comparison, our work focuses on a range of arithmetic, commonsense,\\nand symbolic tasks that require multi-hop reasoning.\\nC.3 Program synthesis and execution\\nUsing intermediate reasoning steps has a long history in program synthesis and execution (Zaremba\\nand Sutskever, 2014, inter alia ). Recent work along in this direction has included a number of\\narchitectural innovations (Cai et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2019; Yan et al., 2020), as well as the use of\\nlarge language models (Chen et al., 2021; Austin et al., 2021). The program execution work closest to\\nours is perhaps Nye et al. (2021), which show that large language models can perform up to 10-digit\\naddition, evaluate polynomials, and execute python programs. Whereas generating a program and\\nthen executing it can be viewed as a type of reasoning, our work generalizes such domain-speciﬁc\\nprimitives to natural language, which is open-domain and relevant to any text-to-text NLP task in\\nprinciple.\\nC.4 Numeric and logical reasoning\\nNumeric and logical reasoning has been a long-studied task in machine learning and natural language\\nprocessing (Lev et al., 2004, inter alia ). Recent work has also aimed to inject numeric reasoning\\nabilities in language models in various ways, such as augmenting BERT with a predeﬁned set of\\nexecutable operations (Andor et al., 2019), including a graph neural network (Ran et al., 2019), and\\nusing specialized training procedures (Pi˛ ekos et al., 2021). Another line of work aims to enable\\nlanguage models to perform logical or formal reasoning, often by verablizing the rules in natural\\nlanguage formal rules using language (Clark et al., 2020; Saeed et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021).\\n24', doc_id='7e0086c9-569d-410e-b6df-206dfc9c18c3', embedding=None, doc_hash='18ccbe33c75c84aa7d47da63d52c204a84a045fcd87ac260a8ef3e5acbe1bc2b', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Perhaps the most-related work here is Recchia (2021), which shows that ﬁnetuning enables longhand\\nmodule operations, which has previously been difﬁcult for performers. Whereas work in this direction\\nis often task-speciﬁc and uses ﬁnetuning, we show that chain-of-thought prompting works for a broad\\nrange of tasks without any ﬁnetuning.\\nC.5 Intermediate language steps\\nExtensive prior work has shown the beneﬁts of endowing neural networks with the ability to produce\\nintermediate steps via training or ﬁnetuning confers various beneﬁts in a range of scenarios. As\\nexamples, it has been shown that natural language intermediate steps can improve performance\\n(Zaidan et al., 2007; Yao et al., 2021; Hase and Bansal, 2022; Gu et al., 2022), improve robustness\\n(Chen et al., 2022), speed up training (Hancock et al., 2018), mitigate bias (Dua et al., 2020), and\\neven help in image and reinforcement learning settings (Andreas et al., 2018). To endow models with\\nthe ability to produce intermediate steps, prior work typically ﬁnetunes models on either manually\\nannotated training datasets (Camburu et al., 2018; Rajani et al., 2019, inter alia ) or generates synthetic\\ndatasets (Talmor et al., 2020; Zelikman et al., 2022). Compared with these training or ﬁnetuning\\nmethods, our work shows that various natural language reasoning abilities can be elicited in off-the-\\nshelf language models of sufﬁcient scale simply via prompting. This prompting setup is important\\nbecause it allows for intermediate step reasoning without a large number of labeled annotations, and\\nbecause a single model can perform a range of reasoning tasks without any gradient updates.\\nD Appendix: Additional Analysis\\nD.1 Correct Chain of Thought Analysis\\nAs mentioned in the main text, we analyze 50 chains of thought from LaMDA 137B that led to\\ncorrect answers in the GSM8K dataset. Of these 50, only one arrived at the correct answer through\\nincorrect reasoning (shown in Table 9: “correct by chance”). The other 49 had correct logic and\\nmath, with examples shown in Table 8. Five had minor imperfections while maintaining coherent and\\nunderstandable logic:\\n• One had underspeciﬁed statements (shown in Table 9: “correct but underspeciﬁed statements”).\\n•One made an unrelated but correct statement (shown in Table 9: “correct but unrelated statement”).\\n•Two had the correct logic but omitted speciﬁc steps in the equation, though it was still understand-\\nable (shown in Table 9: “correct but imperfect equation”).\\n•One had the correct math but inverted the semantics (shown in Table 9: “correct but inverted\\nsemantics”)\\nTable 8: Example of correct chains of thought produced by the model for the GSM8K dataset.\\nQUESTION :James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total\\nmeters does he run a week?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each\\nsprint. So he runs 60 meters x 3 sprints x 3 times a week. That is 60 meters x 9. The answer is 540. X\\nQUESTION :Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s\\niPhone. If Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old, how old is Brandon’s iPhone?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): Brandon’s iPhone is 4 times as old as Ben’s iPhone. Ben’s iPhone is 2\\ntimes older than Suzy’s iPhone. So Brandon’s iPhone is 4 x 2 = 8 times older than Suzy’s iPhone. Suzy’s iPhone\\nis 1 year old. So Brandon’s iPhone is 8 x 1 = 8 years old. The answer is 8. X\\nQUESTION :Jean has 30 lollipops. Jean eats 2 of the lollipops. With the remaining lollipops, Jean wants to\\npackage 2 lollipops in one bag. How many bags can Jean ﬁll?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT): Jean started with 30 lollipops. She ate 2 of them. So she has 28 lollipops\\nleft. She wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag.

One-third of them jump in and swim in the ocean.\\nAnother one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. How many penguins are still left sunbathing?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BY CHANCE ):There are 36 penguins. One-third of them jump in and swim in\\nthe ocean. So that is 12 penguins. Another one-third go inside the cave to eat their dinner. So that is 12 penguins.\\nThe answer is 12.\\nQUESTION :John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. There are an\\nadditional 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. How many total windows are there between the\\nhouses?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNDERSPECIFIED STATEMENTS ):There are 2 houses with 3 bedrooms\\neach. Each bedroom has 2 windows each. So there are 2 x 3 = 6 windows in each house. There are an additional\\n4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms. So there are 4 + 4 = 8 windows in each house. So there are\\n6 x 2 = 12 windows in each house. So there are 12 + 8 = 20 windows in both houses. The answer is 20.\\nQUESTION :If Ann is 9 years old and her brother is twice her age, how old will her brother be in 3 years?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT UNRELATED STATEMENT ):Ann is 9 years old. Her brother is twice her\\nage. So her brother is 18 years old. In 3 years, she will be 12. So her brother will be 18 + 3 = 21 years old. The\\nanswer is 21.\\nQUESTION :A local gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon. An app company is offering $.20 cashback per\\ngallon if you ﬁll up at this station. If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, how much with their gas be, after the\\ncashback rewards?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT IMPERFECT EQUATION ):The gas is originally 3 dollars per gallon. If\\nyou buy 10 gallons, that is 3 x 10 = 30 dollars. If you get 20 cents off per gallon, that is 20 x 10 = 2 dollars. So\\nthe total is 30 - 2 = 28 dollars. The answer is 28 dollars.\\nQUESTION :Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves in her department store’s Santa village. A third of\\nthe elves quit after children vomit on them, then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. How\\nmany elves are left?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT IMPERFECT EQUATION ):Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers. A third of\\nthem quit. So 60 - 1/3 = 40 elves are left. Then 10 elves quit. So 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left. The answer is 30\\nelves.\\nQUESTION :Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the ﬁreman’s luncheon.

At the end of the evening, after the\\nguests had taken and eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. How many pieces were\\ntaken by the guests?\\nMODEL ANSWER (CORRECT BUT INVERTED SEMANTICS ):5 pies were baked and cut into 8 pieces each.\\nThe 5 pies were then served to the guests. 8 x 5 = 40 pieces of pie. The guests ate 14 pieces of pie. 40 - 14 = 26\\npieces of pie were left. The answer is 26.

There are many ways that a chain of thought can be incorrect, making the design\\nof error categorization non-trivial. We decided to categorize errors into what changes are needed to\\nmake the chain of thought correct, with the goal of elucidating how the model can be improved in the\\nfuture.\\nWe found that many chains of thought can be made correct with one of the following three classes of\\nmodiﬁcation.\\n•Calculator error only. We found that 8% of the chains of thought were completely correct except\\nfor a calculator error—in other words, applying an external calculator to equations, as done in\\nCobbe et al. (2021), would make the chain of thought correct. An example of this type of error is\\nshown in Table 10: “calculator error only”. Indeed, the solve rate of chain-of-thought prompting\\non for LaMDA 137B GSM8K went up from 14.3% to 17.3% when we added a Python program\\nas an external calculator, as shown in Table 2. Also, 34% of the examples contained calculator\\nerrors in addition to other types of errors. However, we perform the rest of the error categorization\\nindependently of calculator errors.\\n•Symbol mapping error. We next found that 16% percent of the chains of thought were correct\\nexcept for what we call symbol mapping errors. We deﬁne a symbol mapping error as when the\\nchain of thought is correct except for the number symbols, and it could be made totally correct by\\nmodifying only the equations and not the words. As one might argue that they could simply place\\nthe correct ﬁnal equation in any chain of thought, we constrain this category to chains of thought\\nwhere the chain of thought can be modiﬁed to be a completely correct reasoning process (not just\\nﬁnal answer). An example of this error category is shown in Table 10: “symbol mapping error”.\\n•One step missing error. Our next category of error is chains of thought which were correct except\\nthat they were missing a single step. In other words, these chains of thoughts could be rewritten to\\nbe correct by adding in an additional reasoning step that was missed by the model. An example of\\nthis error category is shown in Table 10: “one step missing error”. We found that 22% percent of\\nthe errors fell into this category.\\nTable 10: Example of incorrect chains of thought, categorized as described in Appendix D.2.\\nQUESTION :Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush has 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. How many thorns\\nare there total?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;CALCULATOR ERROR ONLY ):Dan plants 3 rose bushes. Each rose bush\\nhas 25 roses. Each rose has 8 thorns. So 3 x 25 x 8 = 300. The answer is 300. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The produced chain of thought could be made correct just by\\nrunning the equation through an external calculator, instead of asking the model to do the computation.\\nQUESTION :Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a\\nyear, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a week as a coach, what’s her annual salary?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;SYMBOL MAPPING ERROR ):Jill gets paid 20 dollars per hour to teach\\nand 30 dollars per hour to be a cheerleading coach. If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher\\nand 15 hours a week as a coach, then she works 50 x 35 = 1750 hours as a teacher and 15 x 30 = 450 hours as a\\ncoach. So she works 1750 + 450 = 2200 hours. She gets paid 20 dollars per hour for 1750 hours and 30 dollars\\nper hour for 450 hours. So her annual salary is 20 x 1750 + 30 x 450 = $36,500. The answer is $36,500. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The model incorrectly mapped “15 x 30” instead of “15 x 50”, and\\nthe chain of thought would be made correct by ﬁxing just that one change (with an external calculator).\\nQUESTION :Kelian has two recipes for preparing dishes, one having 20 instructions and the second one having\\ntwice as many instructions as the ﬁrst one. How many instructions does Kelian have to read to prepare the two\\ndishes?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;ONE STEP MISSING ERROR ):Kelian has two recipes. One has 20 instruc-\\ntions. The other has twice as many instructions as the ﬁrst one. So the second one has 40 instructions. So Kelian\\nhas to read 40 instructions to prepare the two dishes. The answer is 40. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :The model answer could be made correct just adding one additional\\nstep (in this case, adding 20 and 40).\\n27', doc_id='ee46c7c6-83a5-4e67-a7bc-d825e37ba3a3', embedding=None, doc_hash='628a3cd1c4db8c547918e2c14feffc30284bb21ec29bb2ec6a1b2934e4d5db34', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='We found that the remaining chains of thought (27 of 50; 54%) would require substantial edits to make\\ninto a correct chain of thought. Almost all cases here involved some error in semantic understanding\\n(see Table 11: “semantic understanding error”), and 8 of the 27 also had incoherent chain of thoughts,\\nmeaning that some statements in the generated chain of thought did not follow from prior ones or\\nviolated basic world knowledge (see Table 11: “incoherent chain of thought error”).\\nTable 11: Example of incorrect chains of thought, categorized as described in Appendix D.2. These\\nchains of thought had multiple mistakes that could not be ﬁxed with minor edits.\\nQUESTION :Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. How many gold coins\\ndoes Gretchen have?\\nMODEL ANSWER (INCORRECT ;SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING ERROR ):Gretchen has 110 coins. There\\nare 30 more gold coins than silver coins. So there are 110 - 30 = 80 silver coins. So there are 80 silver coins and\\n110 - 80 = 30 gold coins.

The rest enrolled in hip-hop\\ndance. So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is the percentage of the students\\nenrolled in hip-hop dance, minus the percentage of the students enrolled in contemporary dance, minus the\\npercentage of the students enrolled in jazz dance. So the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop\\ndance is (25 + 20) - (25 + 20) = 100%. The answer is 100%. 7\\nEXPLANATION FOR ERROR CATEGORY :This chain of thought is incoherent in that the percent of entire\\nstudents enrolled in hip-hope dance cannot be the percent of student enrolled in hip-hop dance minus another\\nterm.\\nOverall, there are no guarantees that the reasoning processes generated by large language models\\nare coherent or factually correct, as underscored by the recent work evaluating the factuality of\\nlanguage model generations and explanations (Maynez et al., 2020; Rashkin et al., 2021; Ye and\\nDurrett, 2022; Marasovi ´c et al., 2022; Wiegreffe et al., 2022). Incorrect reasoning processes can lead\\nto both incorrect ﬁnal answers as well as accidentally correct ﬁnal answers (with accidentally correct\\nﬁnal answers being more likely for tasks such as binary classiﬁcation as opposed to free response).\\nImproving the factuality of language model generations with respect to context and world knowledge\\nis an important direction open problems in language model research and could also be expected to\\npotentially improve multi-step reasoning abilities of language models. One potential method for\\nimproving the quality of decoding could involve generating multiple reasoning paths and scoring\\neach of them with a veriﬁer, though this requires training the veriﬁer (Cobbe et al., 2021; Shen et al.,\\n2021; Thoppilan et al., 2022).\\nD.3 Additional Robustness Analysis\\nAs the experiments in the main paper use a ﬁxed number of few-shot exemplars (8; as constrained by\\nthe input length of 1024 tokens), we verify that the chain-of-thought prompting is robust to various\\nnumbers of few-shot exemplars. We run experiments for LaMDA 137B, comparing chain-of-thought\\nprompting with standard prompting for the ﬁve datasets where standard prompting had a mostly ﬂat\\nscaling curve (the largest model did not achieve high performance). As shown in Figure 11, the\\nimprovement of chain-of-thought prompting over standard prompting remains robust to varying the\\nnumber of few-shot exemplars in the prompt.\\n28', doc_id='f9649dac-b07c-442d-bd61-e8f4326b58e8', embedding=None, doc_hash='144e7c60db958b6f0150d8298bbbec668f75352cc27e3df20048adc2f624f112', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='12468051015 Solve rate (%)GSM8K\\n124680204060MultiArith\\n(MAWPS)\\n124680255075100\\nNumber of few-shot exemplarsSports\\nUnderstandingStandard prompting\\nChain of thought prompting\\n124680255075100Coin Flip\\n12340255075100Last Letter\\nConcatenation\\nFigure 11: The improvement of chain of thought prompting over standard prompting appears robust\\nto varying the number of few-shot exemplars in the prompt.\\nTable 12: Summary of math word problem benchmarks we use in this paper with examples.

Second, we conduct experiments using the\\npublicly available GPT-3 API for four model scales text-ada-001, text-babbage-001, text-curie-001,\\ntext-davinci-002). Finally, we make exact inputs, targets, and predictions for LaMDA 137B for each\\ntask available as a zip ﬁle in the supplementary material.\\nE.2 Computational Resources\\nFor all three language models we evaluated, we did prompting-based inference only. No ﬁnetuning\\nwas done for this paper.

Introduction\\nSentence representation learning is a fundamental problem in natural lan-\\nguage processing (NLP). It learns to encode sentences into compact, dense\\nvectors, called embeddings, which can be broadly useful for a wide range of\\ntasks, such as Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) [1], language understanding\\nand evaluation [2, 3] and information retrieval [4, 5].\\nRecent work has shown that finetuning pre-trained language models with\\ncontrastive learning is the most effective and efficient for sentence represen-\\ntation learning. The instance of contrastive learning makes embeddings of\\nsemantically similar pairs close to each other while pushing dissimilar ones\\napart [6]. In contrastive learning, previous methods [7, 8, 9] use multiple ways\\nto construct sentence pairs for supervised or unsupervised training. Specifi-\\ncally, supervised contrastive methods [7, 10] usually create sentence pairs us-\\ning several publicly available Natural language inference (NLI) datasets, like\\nStanford NLI (SNLI) dataset [11] and MultiGenre NLI (MNLI) dataset [12].\\nMeanwhile, unsupervised contrastive methods [7, 13, 14] leverage unlabeled\\nsentences from Wikipedia or any other public resources. In general, super-\\nvised contrastive learning methods outperform unsupervised ones although\\nthe former need multi-source large-scale labeled training data. Usually, previ-\\nous research follows the standard evaluation protocol that uses the SentEval\\ntoolkit [15] on the standard semantic textual similarity (STS) benchmark for\\nevaluation purposes. Accordingly, several benchmark datasets for STS and\\nNLI have been released by targeting at English.\\nWhen it comes to Japanese, things are different. Although JSNLI [22]\\nand JSICK [23] datasets are publicly available, STS12-16 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20],\\nSTS-B [21] and 7 transfer tasks from SentEval [15], and MNLI datasets [12]\\nin Japanese do not exist. Here, JSNLI dataset is translated from the SNLI\\ndataset using machine translation, and JSICK dataset is made manually\\nbased on the SICK [24] dataset. We believe that the lack of publicly avail-\\nable benchmark datasets for Japanese STS has led to the lack of interest in\\nbuilding Japanese sentence representation models and devising applications\\nbased on them. Motivated by this, we believe it is time to construct and\\nrelease a comprehensive Japanese STS benchmark. In addition, we publish\\n2', doc_id='5838d0ce-7ed6-41aa-b31b-eddab5f95bad', embedding=None, doc_hash='dee3b3f4a4691df41ca213dfa61e371ad6a93e5dc797d88d5a6a434abf856180', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='various Japanese sentence embedding models trained mainly by contrastive\\nlearning and propose a novel effectively method as our core work of this paper\\nfor the domain-specific downstream tasks.\\nIn this context, we propose an efficient Japanese sentence representation\\nlearning framework that leverages data generation to perform contrastive\\nlearning on domain-specific downstream tasks. This framework is named\\nJCSE that is derived from “Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings\\nfor Japanese”. JCSE is built upon pre-trained transformer language mod-\\nels [25, 26]. We first collect a domain-specific raw corpus in a target domain.\\nAfterward, we finetune a pre-trained data generator (in our case T5 [26]) on\\nour collected domain-specific corpus using unsupervised fill-in-the-blank-style\\ndenoising training. It is then used to construct negative (contradictory) pairs\\nfor input sentences. In previous research [23], Japanese language models pre-\\ndict entailment labels without considering word order or case particles. The\\nexperimental settings for whether the existence of case particles can change\\nentailment labels [23] inspire us to investigate which word types in Japanese\\nare the most relevant for different Japanese language models. The results of\\nour relevant content words experiments [27] show that nouns are the most\\nrelevant content words in a Japanese sentence. It means that negative pairs\\nfor input sentences can be constructed by substituting nouns in them using\\nthe finetuned data generator. Referring to SimCSE [7], we construct pos-\\nitive pairs by simply using different dropout masks. In this way, sentence\\npairs are synthesized for contrastive learning. Finally, we apply a two-stage\\ncontrastive learning recipe that finetune a Japanese language model first on\\nsynthesized sentence pairs and then on JSNLI.\\nTo evaluate our method JCSE compared with various existing embedding\\nmethods, we choose multiple proper Japanese sentence embedding models\\nbased on the results of our established Japanese STS benchmark. On the STS\\nbenchmark, Japanese sentence embedding models yield similar results to the\\ncase of English, that is, applying contrastive learning to sentence embedding\\nmodels leads to performance improvements. Concern about our Japanese\\nSTS benchmark, as described above, STS12-16 and STS-B in Japanese still\\ndo not exist. Referring to previous research [22, 28], machine translation\\nis used to translate English STS12-16 and STS-B datasets into Japanese.\\nCombining the translated datasets with existing JSICK [23] and Japanese\\nSTS (JSTS) datasets included in the JGLUE [53], we construct and release\\n3', doc_id='4a39babe-1332-48f7-9d84-f8dfa84a5854', embedding=None, doc_hash='a23b0e5fa3f1e297a3946c0f0fdce3d5348de38e1f73f585e2aa38385eed0ffc', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='this comprehensive version of the Japanese STS benchmark1.\\nIn parallel, with the direct transfer of Japanese sentence embedding mod-\\nels to the two domain-specific downstream tasks, contrastive learning leads\\nto better performance than previous embedding methods, but those improve-\\nments are diminutive.

The results show JCSE achieves competitive performance\\nafter the first finetuning using synthesized sentence pairs, and attains fur-\\nther improvement after the second finetuning of semi-supervised training on\\nJSNLI. Surprisingly, we find that directly integrating our collected domain-\\nspecific corpus into the Japanese sentence embedding models using previous\\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised contrastive learning methods can also signifi-\\ncantly improve the performance of the domain-specific downstream tasks.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\\n•We propose JCSE that is a novel effective and efficient Japanese sen-\\ntence representation learning framework for domain adaptation on Japanese\\ndomain-specific downstream tasks.\\n•We construct and release a comprehensive Japanese STS benchmark.\\nTo our best knowledge, we are the first to evaluate multiple Japanese\\nsentence embedding models on this comprehensive benchmark.\\n•We propose a new human-annotated QAbot dataset for an information\\nretrieval task in a Japanese educational domain.\\n2. Background and Related Work\\n2.1. Contrastive Learning\\nContrastive learning aims to learn effective representation by pulling se-\\nmantically close neighbors together and pushing apart non-neighbors [30].\\nA training set of contrastive learning is defined by paired examples each of\\n1https://github.com/mu-kindai/JCSE\\n4', doc_id='34d37c94-e186-425a-853f-c6789d34905a', embedding=None, doc_hash='f31ec015cfd9c3747d7b4a758dc7af8c0bb9dc4b3995f406d3a819507a8f620b', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='which is denoted by D={(vi, v+\\ni)}. Here, viis the embedding of the ith\\nsentence and v+\\niis the one of a sentence semantically related to the ith sen-\\ntence. During training, v+\\niis considered a positive example for viand all\\nother examples in a batch are considered negatives [31, 32]. For a mini-batch\\nofNpairs, the contrastive loss function is defined as:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ, (1)\\nwhere τis a temperature hyperparameter, sim( v1, v2) is the cosine similarity\\nv1⊤v2\\n∥v1∥·∥v2∥. When additional negatives v−\\njare provided for vi, the contrastive\\nloss can be enhanced as:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1(esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ+esim(vi,v−\\nj)/τ). (2)\\nSimCSE [7] applies different hard negatives from other in-batch negatives,\\nextends Eq. 2 to incorporate weighting of different negatives:\\nL=esim(vi,v+\\ni)/τ\\nPN\\nj=1(esim(vi,v+\\nj)/τ+α1j\\niesim(vi,v−\\nj)/τ), (3)\\nwhere 1j\\ni∈ {0,1}is an indicator that equals 1 if and only if i=j, and αis\\na weighting hyperparameter.\\nOne crucial question in contrastive learning is how to construct ( vi, v+\\ni)\\npairs. Some research [8, 9, 33] apply multiple augmentation techniques such\\nas word deletion, reordering, cutoff, and substitution. Kim et al. [34] directly\\nuse the hidden representation of BERT as well as its final sentence embed-\\ndings. SimCSE [7] simply feeds the same input to the encoder twice and\\nconstructs positive pairs using different dropout masks. This simple method\\nhas proved to be more effective than other strategies. Previous methods\\nmainly focus on constructing positive pairs while negative pairs are gener-\\nated through random sampling. Several works [35, 36] in the computer vision\\ncommunity show that hard negative examples are essential for contrastive\\nlearning. Robinson et al. [37] use an importance sampling method to select\\nhard negative examples. For NLP, Kalantidis et al. [38] improve MoCo [39]\\nby generating hard negative examples through mixing positive and nega-\\ntive examples in the memory bank which keeps a queue with features of the\\n5', doc_id='b58f0c2a-65ff-4bf6-ba6d-4cf784c6a6ea', embedding=None, doc_hash='9fe7b602e0f4a28700fe8a2ed6ae1fd6f26d17638c178509ae3c76a08d39f9e3', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='last few batches. MixCSE [13] constructs artificial hard negative features\\nvia mixing both positive and negative samples for unsupervised sentence\\nrepresentation learning. While supervised sentence representation learning\\nrelies on large-scale human-annotated sentence pairs, we often face with the\\nscarcity of human-annotated datasets, especially low-resource languages like\\nJapanese.\\n2.2. Domain Adaption for downstream task\\nDomain Adaptation is a fundamental challenge in NLP. The most com-\\nmon domain adaption technique for a pre-trained language model is domain-\\nadaptive pre-training which continues pre-taining on in-domain data. Recent\\nwork [40] has shown empirically that domain adaptation improves a language\\nmodel’s performance on a target domain. Specifically, the researchers in\\n[40] experiment with eight classification tasks ranging across four domains\\n(biomedical and computer science publications, news, and reviews). The\\nresults show that continued pre-training of an already powerful language\\nmodel on the domain consistently improves performance on tasks in a target\\ndomain. BioBERT [41] shows that pre-training BERT on biomedical cor-\\npora largely improves its performance on downstream tasks of biomedical\\ntext mining. Meanwhile, Guo et al. [42] and Ma et al. [43] show that neu-\\nral retrieval models trained on a general domain often do not transfer well,\\nespecially for specialized domains.\\nThere is no labeled training data in many target domains. To over-\\ncome this, leveraging generative models to produce synthetic data has been\\npreviously explored. Du et al. [44] first apply a seq2seq model for auto-\\nmatic question generation from text passages in a reading comprehension\\ntask. Puri et al. [45] first demonstrate that a QA model trained on purely\\nsynthetic questions and answers can outperform models trained on human-\\nlabeled data on SQuAD1.1. Ma et al. [43] and Liang et al. [46] use synthetic\\nqueries for domain adaptive neural retrieval. Yue et al. [47] leverage question\\ngeneration to synthesize QA pairs on clinical contexts and boost QA models\\nwithout requiring manual annotations. Another research [48] trains a QA\\nsystem on both source data and generated data from a target domain with\\na contrastive adaptation loss. However, to our best knowledge, there is no\\nrecent research that addresses domain adaptation in a domain-specific task\\ninvolving Japanese sentences.\\n6', doc_id='66ff3abc-d447-4a16-9095-768c519990b3', embedding=None, doc_hash='e0a97884e3a5527f0c4c28dd2529cead97ebe5e22449f14c0f73b617bf37018f', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='2.3. Non-English data construction\\nWith the development of multilingual pre-trained language models, gen-\\neral language understanding frameworks for languages other than English\\nhave been created, and NLI datasets have been multilingualized. Conneau\\net al. [49] provided a cross-lingual NLI (XNLI) dataset by translating MNLI\\n[12] into 15 languages, including languages with few language resources such\\nas Urdu and Swahili. However, Japanese is not included in it.\\nAs examples of non-English datasets, OCNLI [50] is a Chinese NLI dataset\\nbuilt from original Chinese multi-genre resources. Ham et al. [28] create\\nKorNLI and KorSTS datasets by translating English NLI and STS-B [21]\\ndatasets into Korean. There are also attempts to translate the SICK dataset\\n[24] into Dutch [51] and Portuguese [52].\\nRegarding Japanese, a Japanese SNLI (JSNLI) dataset [22] is constructed\\nby employing machine translation to translate the English SNLI dataset into\\nJapanese and automatically filtering out unnatural sentences. JSICK [23]\\ndataset is manually translated from the English SICK dataset [24]. Ya-\\nhoo Japan constructs a Japanese GLUE benchmark [53] from scratch with-\\nout translation due to the cultural/social discrepancy between English and\\nJapanese. Although employing machine translation incurs several possibil-\\nities to produce unnatural sentences, it is more cost-efficient than manual\\ntranslation and reconstruction from scratch.\\n3. Contrastive Learning of Sentence Embeddings for Japanese\\nFig. 1 illustrates an overview of JCSE. For a target domain, we collect a\\nraw corpus from public resources and use GINZA2, an open-source Japanese\\nNLP library, to divide the corpus into sentences. Next, we carry out text nor-\\nmalization like removing markup and non-text content, then drop sentences\\nwhose length is less than five after the tokenization by GINZA. A pre-trained\\nT5 model is finetuned. Afterward, unlabeled sentences in the target domain\\nare fed into the finetuned T5 model to generate negative pairs. Then, positive\\npairs are defined by simply using different dropout masks, and the combi-\\nnation of positive and negative pairs forms synthesized input pairs. Finally,\\nwe train a sentence embedding model using contrastive learning based on\\nsynthesized pairs and human-annotated sentence pairs, here is the JSNLI\\ndataset. More details of the above-mentioned processes are described below.\\n2https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza\\n7', doc_id='d3917395-65da-4923-9632-9e7082b23450', embedding=None, doc_hash='7a3f60fbaa8e4f65d051aa810fead49f2a64dcf8f32dff694b877de85f843926', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Figure 1: An overview of JCSE.\\n3.1.

We leverage our university’s syllabus data and\\nteaching materials published in Google Classroom of courses in the depart-\\nment of informatics. In addition, private question-answer data are collected\\nby running a QAbot on Slack5which is a popular instant messaging software\\nand utilized in different courses of our department.

More specifically, we\\napply the Japanese T5 Version 1.1 model which is an improved version of\\nthe original T5 model. This new version released by Google is built by\\nunsupervised pre-training and has not been fine-tuned on any downstream\\ntask. We formulate data generation as a fill-in-the-blank task where the T5\\nmodel predicts missing words within a corrupted piece of text in a text-to-\\ntext format.\\nAs described in Section 1, we find that nouns are the most relevant con-\\ntent words in Japanese sentences. Hence, for the target domain unlabeled\\nsentences, we first perform part-of-speech (POS) tagging for every sentence\\nusing GINZA and spaCy [54]. The POS-tags labels are determined using\\nspaCy [54]. Then we mask all noun tokens, more precisely mask noun chunks\\nrather than noun tokens to generate more natural data. Each corrupted noun\\nchunk is replaced by a sentinel token that is unique over the example. The\\nsentinel token is assigned a token ID that is unique to the sentence. The\\nsentinel IDs are special tokens that are added to the T5 model’s vocabulary\\nand do not correspond to any word piece [26]. We formulate our data gen-\\neration as a fill-in-the-blank task where the input is a sentence corrupted\\nwith multiple sentinel tokens and the target output is the relevant text in\\n5https://slack.com/\\n6https://github.com/mu-kindai/JCSE\\n9', doc_id='c59a88e6-d280-4f36-ab46-eb037704797d', embedding=None, doc_hash='4068c883cdc891faa1a24fa4fa79964f9c6d145848099b642149b8e22d92eed7', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='the missing location.

Also, the word distribution of general\\nand specific domain corpora are quite different, so there is no ability for the\\npre-trained T5 model to generate proper domain-specific terms. Hence, it\\nis essential to finetune the pre-trained T5 model on unlabeled data in the\\ntarget domain using unsupervised denoising training.

Experiments\\nIn this section, we describe the experiments for this paper. To evaluate\\nthe performance of existing sentence representation methods and choose the\\nones compared to JCSE, first we establish a Japanese STS benchmark and\\nevaluate various Japanese sentence embedding models on it. Then we do\\nthe relevant content words experiments and find that nouns are the most\\nrelevant content words for Japanese language models. Afterward, we generate\\ncontradictory sentences using finetuned data generator and conduct domain\\nadaptation for down-stream tasks using contrastive learning with a two-stage\\ntraining recipe. Last, we evaluate JCSE compared with direct transfer and\\nother training strategies on two domain-specific downstream tasks. More\\nexperiment details are described following.\\n4.1. Japanese STS benchmark Construction\\nWe release a Japanese STS benchmark in our work. We combine the\\npublished JSICK [23] and JSTS [53] datasets with translated STS12-16 and\\nSTS-B datasets using machine translation. The translated datasets are de-\\nrived from original English datasets. We apply a similar translation strategy\\nby referring to the previous methods [22, 28].\\nFirst, we translate all of the STS12-16 and STS-B datasets into Japanese\\nusing Google translate API7and DeepL translate API8. Then, the translated\\nsentences are automatically filtered based on their BLEU scores [55]. More\\nspecifically, we translate each of the translated Japanese datasets back into\\nEnglish using the same machine translator, then we compute the BLEU1\\nscore between the original and translated English sentences. We find that\\nmost of the BLEU scores are 0 when using N > 1 ofN-gram, so we just apply\\nthe BLEU1 score. Unlike the previous research [22, 28], we do not translate\\nsentences in the development and test sets using human translation or post-\\nedit translation results by professional translators due to cost efficiency.\\nLast, to ensure the quality and decide on the translation data translated\\nfrom Google or DeepL translator, we conduct an experiment by referring to\\nthe previous method [22] that trains a linear regression model on different\\ntranslated data defined by diverse BLEU1 score thresholds. Detailedly, a\\nlinear model is built by adding a linear layer on the top layer’s CLS token of\\n7https://cloud.google.com/translate/\\n8https://www.deepl.com/en/pro-api\\n11', doc_id='9f6f064a-d4ab-469a-a47c-0f0772fdb8e7', embedding=None, doc_hash='3444d8132a3b96814409c146bc712107be0929778271b920ea10c30086018e3f', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Google translator\\nBLEU threshold - 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3\\ndatasize 21172 20612 20449 19508 18207 16694 14904\\nMAE 0.4415 0.4443 0.4807 0.4493 0.4963 0.4966 0.4916\\nMSE 0.3384 0.336 0.3793 0.3332 0.412 0.4191 0.4018\\nR2 0.6481 0.6505 0.6058 0.6537 0.5727 0.5632 0.5822\\nDeepL translator\\nBLEU threshold - 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3\\ndatasize 21172 19337 19144 18368 17535 16683 15727\\nMAE 0.4206 0.433 0.4314 0.4397 0.451 0.4448 0.442\\nMSE 0.3058 0.3135 0.3117 0.324 0.342 0.3312 0.328\\nR2 0.6894 0.6802 0.6834 0.6711 0.6529 0.6638 0.6666\\nLast edition\\ndatasize 19330 MAE 0.4119 MSE 0.2821 R2 0.7137\\nTable 1: The performance of different models trained on different translated data.

We consider\\nboth unsupervised and supervised sentence representation models to apply a\\ncomprehensive evaluation. Unsupervised baselines include average FastText\\nembeddings [56], average BERT embeddings [25], and post-processing meth-\\nods such as BERT-flow [57] and BERT-whitening [58]. We also compare\\nseveral recent state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods including Sim-\\nCSE [7], MixCSE [13], and DiffCSE [14]. Other supervised methods include\\nSBERT [59], CoSENT9and SimCSE [7].\\nWe apply official codes to train a Japanese sentence embedding model\\nbased on each of the above-mentioned sentence representation methods. We\\ntried various hyperparameters in the training process, and find that the of-\\nficially recommended hyperparameters are better than others in most situa-\\ntions. Thus, in this section, all the Japanese sentence embedding models are\\ntrained in the hyperparameters referred to as relative officially recommended\\ntraining settings. The models trained based on BERT-base or BERT-large\\nusing their public checkpoints10.\\nFor unsupervised contrastive learning methods, we apply the Wikipedia\\n9https://github.com/bojone/CoSENT\\n10https://huggingface.co/cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese & https://huggingface.co/cl-\\ntohoku/bert-large-japanese\\n13', doc_id='6fa507d0-e78b-4eb5-b7ff-0efb951c7aad', embedding=None, doc_hash='979a82d08663d047ef757e6deee38ffa4839fb28683dd288c2949c56269b1ae6', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='data as training data. We use WikiExtractor11and GiNZA to make unlabeled\\nsentences from the latest Japanese Wikipedia corpus, and randomly sample\\n106sentences as training data. For supervised methods, all the models are\\ntrained just on the JSNLI dataset due to data availability.\\nTable 3 shows the evaluation results. The performances of Japanese sen-\\ntence embedding models on the Japanese STS tasks is a little different from\\nthose on the English STS benchmark tasks. For the unsupervised methods,\\nrecent state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods perform better than pre-\\nvious baselines, and the MixCSE method shows the best or nearly best re-\\nsults on almost all STS tasks. Surprisingly, we find that models trained on\\nRoBERTa [60] pre-trained checkpoints12using a contrastive learning method\\nsuch as SimCSE (i.e., SimCSE-RoBERTa-base model) get poor results even\\nworse than previous baselines on some STS tasks, so we do not choose mod-\\nels trained on RoBERTa checkpoints to compare with JCSE. For supervised\\nmethods, the models using the contrastive learning method should achieve\\nbetter performance than the previous state-of-the-art SBERT [59] model, re-\\nversely, SBERT beyond SimCSE in our experiments because of much smaller\\ntraining data compared to those in the English experiments. Specifically, we\\nuse the JSNLI dataset which is about half of the training data in the English\\nexperiments [7], which uses the SNLI [11] and MNLI [12] datasets. This\\npoint easily overlooked in others research, but uncovered in our experiment.\\nThis is also the reason that unsupervised contrastive learning methods get\\nbetter performance than supervised contrastive learning methods in our ex-\\nperiments. After checking Table 3, we can find that the results on the human-\\nannotated STS datasets and the machine-translated datasets indicate differ-\\nent trends. This reflects the obvious gap between machine translation and\\nhuman annotation. To emphasize the performance on the human-annotated\\nSTS tasks, we also show the results just on JSICK and JSTS datasets in\\nTable 4. The results show that supervised contrastive learning methods\\nget nearly competitive performance compared with unsupervised contrastive\\nlearning methods even the labeled training data is limited. Contrastive learn-\\ning methods surpass previous methods which is similar with the results in\\nTable 3.\\n11https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor\\n12https://huggingface.co/nlp-waseda/roberta-base-japanese &\\nhttps://huggingface.co/nlp-waseda/roberta-large-japanese\\n14', doc_id='a57d1808-f9a8-49b7-9182-37cfcde5d062', embedding=None, doc_hash='45f7ee1581cb7eb14ec62b138fe6e2fd66b4d76e248184912135824ab2b0c280', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Model STS12 STS13 STS14 STS15 STS16 STS-B JSICK JSTS Avg.\\nUnsupervised models\\nFastText embeddings (avg.) 42.78 51.71 42.45 54.24 54.06 51.30 74.76 60.23 53.94\\nBERT-base (first-last avg.) 38.66 52.06 36.41 55.69 57.06 51.39 71.97 65.19 53.55\\nBERT-base-flow 44.25 55.60 42.62 65.77 60.67 55.10 77.26 64.90 58.27\\nBERT-base-whitening 39.14 55.19 41.76 57.27 57.93 46.26 71.86 56.00 53.18\\nSimCSE-BERT-base 56.82 66.45 55.66 74.80 72.73 69.71 77.20 71.66 68.13\\nSimCSE-BERT-large 55.26 62.66 51.95 72.76 69.49 65.20 77.63 72.98 65.99\\nSimCSE-RoBERTa-base 48.65 60.09 46.97 66.10 65.29 59.88 72.32 63.82 60.39\\nMixCSE-BERT-base 55.07 67.45 56.94 74.35 73.11 70.21 76.97 71.85 68.24\\nMixCSE-BERT-large 56.56 64.59 54.84 74.55 70.85 67.76 78.15 73.89 67.65\\nDiffCSE-BERT-base 57.59 67.07 55.93 74.07 72.88 69.37 76.29 71.07 68.03\\nSupervised models\\nSBERT-base 58.79 60.51 53.30 68.64 66.59 64.76 65.25 75.28 64.14\\nSBERT-large 60.57 64.27 54.24 70.92 65.91 66.17 67.68 76.84 65.83\\nCoSENT 61.73 58.28 52.46 64.72 63.02 63.27 56.81 74.17 61.81\\nSimCSE-BERT-base 51.65 54.43 46.49 63.92 60.81 57.33 74.19 69.12 59.74\\nSimCSE-BERT-large 50.29 56.47 48.10 67.76 59.64 59.63 77.48 69.73 60.80\\nTable 3: Sentence embedding performance on STS tasks (Spearman’s correlation, “all”\\nsetting).

Relevant Content Words\\nThe core insight of JCSE is to generate target domain contradiction sen-\\ntence pairs for contrastive learning. As we described above, we find that\\nnouns are the most relevant content words and construct negative pairs for\\nthe anchor sentences by substituting noun phrases in them. Empirically, not\\nall word types play an equal role in determining the semantics of a Japanese\\nsentence. A previous study [23] insufficiently verifies this opinion but gives\\nus inspiration.\\nIn this section, we investigate which part-of-speech (POS) tags mainly\\ninfluence on examining if a Japanese sentence pair is semantically similar or\\nnot for different Japanese sentence embedding models. To measure this, we\\nborrow the approach used in TSDAE [27]. We select a sentence pair ( a, b)\\nthat is labeled as relevant and find the word that maximally reduces the\\ncosine-similarity score for the pair ( a, b):\\nˆw= argmaxw(cossim( a, b)−min(cossim( a\\\\w, b),cossim( a, b\\\\w))) (6)\\namong all words wthat appear in either a or b. We record the POS tags for\\nˆwand compute the distribution of POS tags among all sentence pairs. The\\nPOS tags are defined using spaCy [54].\\nThe results on the three datasets are shown in Figure 2. We find that\\nnouns (NOUN) are by far the most relevant content words in a Japanese sen-\\ntence across the three datasets, and we do not perceive significant differences\\nbetween all three datasets. This result is important for our method because\\nit experimentally validates the theoretical foundation of our method. That is,\\nit is practical to substitute nouns to construct contradiction sentence pairs.\\n4.4. Experiment Setting\\nIn this section, we describe two experiment settings in our method, in-\\ncluding data generation, and domain adaptation.\\nData generation : We bridge a gap between the scarcity of domain-\\nspecific data in low-resource language and the demand of sufficient training\\ndata for contrastive learning using data generation. In our work, we first fine-\\ntune the pre-trained T5-base checkpoint on the target domain corpus to get\\nour target domain data generator. Then we mask all noun chunks in every\\nsentence with unique sentinel tokens as an input of the data generator. Af-\\nterward, we apply a simple unsampled beam search decode algorithm [61, 62]\\n16', doc_id='734ed07b-aafe-42f1-923d-89a4a24c74e9', embedding=None, doc_hash='2db367c648b60e3280985225364bf7edfbda051e287b5c174564e5aafd8640e1', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Figure 2: POS tags for the most relevant content words in sentences.

We use Adafactor [64] as the optimizer and set\\nthe learning rate to 0.001 implemented using Pytorch and Huggingface and\\ntrained on three NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti.\\nDomain adaption : JCSE focuses on domain adaption characterized by\\nthe following two-stage contrastive learning recipe. A pre-trained sentence\\nembedding model is firstly adapted to a target domain by fine-tuning it on\\nthe synthesized generated sentence pairs. Then, the model is further fine-\\ntuned on labeled JSNLI data. We find that this training sequence, first on\\nthe synthesized generated data and then on JSNLI data, is better for our\\nmethod where reverse training sequence can harm the performance.\\nIn our experiment, both two training stages utilize the improved con-\\ntrastive learning method that incorporates different weighting with different\\nhard negatives. The training objective is described in section 3.3. In stage\\none, to formulate the triple training data {v, v+, v−}, we apply a generated\\ncontradictory sentence as v−based on vto get a negative pair. For the en-\\ntailment sentence pairs, we simply feed the sentence vto the encoder twice\\nand get two different embeddings with different dropout masks v,v+. In\\nstage two, we construct triple training data using the JSNLI dataset that\\nchoose the sentence pair whose label is entailment as the positive pair v,v+\\nand find the negative sentence v−in the pair whose label is contradiction for\\n12https://huggingface.co/sonoisa/t5-base-japanese-v1.1\\n17', doc_id='aac4e3e2-2c62-4a95-8d9b-9c02e3c23fbd', embedding=None, doc_hash='aa71d76934a6856721703b2dbf96d096659b03f766cbe03150524b4c32e18d8b', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Clinical Domain\\nOriginal Sentence\\n幻聴が増悪し、アルコール性精神障害の合併が疑われ、精神科受診が適切と判断された。\\nThe auditory hallucinations worsened, complications of alcoholic psychosis were suspected, and a psychiatric consultation was deemed appropriate.\\nSynthetic Contradiction Sentence\\n徐々に症状が増悪し、急性大動脈解離の急性大動脈解離が疑われ、緊急手術が適切と判断された。\\nGradual worsening of symptoms, acute aortic dissection of acute aortic dissection was suspected, and emergency surgery was deemed appropriate.\\nアルコール依存症の症状が増悪し、急性大動脈解離のリスクファクタ ーの増大が疑われ、緊急手術が適切と判断された。\\nThe patient’s symptoms of alcoholism were exacerbated and an increased risk factor for acute aortic dissection was suspected, and\\nemergency surgery was deemed appropriate.\\n少しずつ症状が増悪し、カテコラミン心筋症の再発や悪化が疑われ、精神科の受診が適切と判断された。\\nThe symptoms gradually worsened, and a psychiatric consultation was deemed appropriate due to a suspected recurrence or\\nworsening of catecholaminergic cardiomyopathy.\\n徐々に意識障害が増悪し、急性硬膜外血腫の再発や急性大動脈解離が疑われ、脳底動脈造影CT撮影が適切と判断された。\\nGradually worsening loss of consciousness, recurrent acute epidural hematoma and acute aortic dissection were suspected, and CT imaging with\\ncontrast-enhanced cerebral basilar artery angiography was deemed appropriate.\\n来院後徐々に症状が増悪し、抗ヒスタゾ ールや精神科受診の妥当性も低いことが疑われ、精神科受診が適切と判断された。\\nSymptoms gradually worsened after the patient’s visit, and it was suspected that antihistazol and psychiatric consultation were not appropriate.\\n症例は徐々に症状が増悪し、COVID-19の急性増悪のリスクファクタ ーの増悪が疑われ、COVID-19の診断が適切と判断された。\\nThe patient had a gradual exacerbation of symptoms, and a diagnosis of COVID-19 was deemed appropriate due to the suspected exacerbation of\\nrisk factors for acute exacerbation of COVID-19.\\nEducational Domain\\nOriginal Sentence\\nとあるクラスで作成されたオブジェクトを他クラスで操作するためにはどのようにすれば 良いでしょうか ?\\nHow can an object created in one class be manipulated by another class?\\nSynthetic Contradiction Sentence\\nMiniDuckSimulator.java で作成されたオブジェクトをSystem.javaで操作するためにはどのようにすれば 良いでしょうか ?\\nHow can I use System.java to manipulate objects created in MiniDuckSimulator.java?\\nAdderServletクラスで作成されたオブジェクトをServletクラスで操作するためにはどのようにすれば 良いでしょうか ?\\nHow can I manipulate objects created in the AdderServlet class with the Servlet class?\\nMetroFair.javaで作成されたオブジェクトをSafariの環境で操作するためにはどのようにすれば 良いでしょうか ?\\nHow can I manipulate objects created in MetroFair.java in the Safari environment?\\nMallardDuckクラスで作成されたオブジェクトをSystem.javaで操作するためにはどのようにすれば 良いでしょうか ?\\nHow can I use System.java to manipulate objects created in the MallardDuck class?\\nDecoyDuckクラスで作成されたオブジェクトをGameDuckクラスで操作するためにはどのようにすれば 良いでしょうか ?\\nHow can an object created in the DecoyDuck class be manipulated in the GameDuck class?\\nDecoyDuckSimulator.java で作成されたオブジェクトをGecoyDuckSimulator.java で操作するためにはどのようにすれば 良いでしょうか ?\\nHow can I use GecoyDuckSimulator.java to manipulate objects created in DecoyDuckSimulator.java?\\nTable 5: Examples of domain-targeted synthetic contradiction sentence pairs based on\\noriginal sentences.

Regarding the training data scale in stage one, we\\nfind that the best performance for the base model is obtained by generating\\n4 contradictory sentences for every anchor sentence, meaning that 4 times\\nmore triplets are formed compared to the size of training data. For the large\\nmodel, 6 times generated contradictory sentences are applied to get the best\\nperformance.\\n4.5. Domian-specific downstream tasks\\nWe evaluate JCSE on two Japanese domain-specific downstream tasks,\\nSTS in a clinical domain and information retrieval in an educational do-\\nmain. The former and latter defined by JACSTS [29] and QAbot datasets,\\nrespectively. Note that these two datasets are human-annotated and our\\nmethod uses no task-specific labeled data, instead it generates contradictory\\nsentences for original sentences and forms triplets to fine-tune a pre-trained\\nmodel.\\nJACSTS JACSTS dataset [29] is a publicly available dataset14for sentence-\\nlevel clinical STS from Japanese case reports. The dataset consists of 3670\\nsentence pairs annotated on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 means that the two\\nsentences are semantically very dissimilar, and 5 means that they are very\\nsimilar.\\nQAbot QAbot dataset is collected from realistic question-answer dia-\\nlogues in certain courses by a bot developed on Slack. The dataset consists\\nof 1142 question-answer pairs that are individually annotated with relevance\\nto each of the 20 queries. For these 20 queries, there is at least one relative\\nquestion labeled as 1 in the dataset. We publicly share this private dataset\\nfor this work15.\\n13https://huggingface.co/cl-tohoku/bert-base-japanese & https://huggingface.co/cl-\\ntohoku/bert-large-japanese\\n14https://github.com/sociocom/Japanese-Clinical-STS\\n15https://github.com/mu-kindai/JCSE\\n19', doc_id='71111905-0ba6-4e8d-abc4-2268a8fd48bd', embedding=None, doc_hash='09585ec1953244809f06519873d2f12d921e9b56f73dc7b0ec47391e930b3a0a', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Model Fine-tune Data JACSTS QAbot\\nMRR MAP P@1 P@5\\nDirect transfer\\nFastText embedding (avg.)

For the\\nQAbot dataset, it is a question retrieval task. Hence, we apply a simple\\nfirst-stage dense retrieval system with two-tower architecture by referring to\\nprevious studies [43, 46, 65]. More specifically, we extract the mean em-\\nbedding on top of layers to obtain the final query/question representation\\nfrom two-tower retrieval models consisting of two independent Japanese sen-\\ntence embedding models: one for each of the query and question towers, re-\\nspectively. We use Mean Average Precision (MAP), Mean Reciprocal Rank\\n(MRR), and Precision at N (P@N) as the evaluation metrics.\\nDuring the evaluation process, we first consider the direct transfer sce-\\nnario where generated target domain data are not used for sentence em-\\nbedding training. Then we evaluate the model for domain adaption, where\\nsynthesized generated target domain data are used in stage one, and the\\ngeneral domain JSNLI data are used in stage two. We also combine the un-\\nlabeled target domain corpus with the Wikipedia corpus for the unsupervised\\ncontrastive learning method in the training process. The results for the two\\ntasks are shown in Table 6.\\nTable 6 shows that our method improves the performance through do-\\n20', doc_id='b3c18435-0eb9-4aec-a9fc-2e39b3b65a77', embedding=None, doc_hash='1811b9ab2d74bfa4131918db6d4215d206892b1ba986aa3546cb8255e74d5521', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='main adaptation using synthesized generated in-domain data. Even just\\nusing the generated data after the first stage of contrastive learning training\\ncan achieve competitive results compared with the out-of-the-box sentence\\nembedding models for direct transfer which means that the first stage train-\\ning uses much less training data than the data used in direct transfer but\\ngets improved performance. And further training using the JSNLI dataset\\ncan further improve our method’s performance after the second stage of con-\\ntrastive learning training. Superingsly, we also find that combining the in-\\ndomain corpus with the Wikipedia corpus in the training process can benefit\\nexisting unsupervised contrastive learning methods. The significant and con-\\nsistent improvements over the two tasks also demonstrate the effectiveness of\\nour data generation approach by fine-tuning a T5 model. Furthermore, com-\\npared to direct transfer and just directly integrating the in-domain corpus\\ninto existing contrastive learning methods, our approach achieves the best\\nperformance on almost all metrics with less training data scale, which con-\\nvincingly demonstrate that JCSE is an efficient and effective Japanese sen-\\ntence representation framework for better sentence embedding on Japanese\\ndomain-specific downstream tasks.\\n5. Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel effective Japanese sentence representa-\\ntion learning framework, JCSE, for the Japanese domain-specific downstream\\ntasks. Meanwhile, we establish Japanese STS benchmark to evaluate various\\nJapanese sentence embedding models using previous state-of-the-art sentence\\nrepresentation learning methods.\\nWe first collect a target domain corpus and finetune a pre-trained data\\ngenerator (T5 model) on this unlabeled data to get our target domain data\\ngenerator. Then, based on our relevant content words experiments, we substi-\\ntute all nouns in sentences by the data generator to generate contradictory\\nsentence pairs. Afterward, we use the synthesized target domain training\\ndata with contrastive learning to train a sentence embedding model. We\\nevaluate the models on two domain-specific downstream tasks, one of which\\nuses the QAbot dataset originally collected by us. Our method achieves\\nsignificantly better performance after the domain adaptation training, com-\\npared with direct transfer and current state-of-the-arts in Japanese. We\\nbelieve that JCSE paves a practicable way for domain-specific downstream\\ntasks in low-resource languages.\\n21', doc_id='1472c0aa-b210-4818-9495-ad5258361949', embedding=None, doc_hash='c4cef132d4c13e75783306ffcdb7bbea26a64eb9c775256a688fdf45f6718daa', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='Our future work includes the establishment of a new Japanese STS bench-\\nmark based on human annotation, in contrast to the current benchmark\\nbased on machine translation.

I NTRODUCTION\\nConversational large language models (LLMs) [1], such as\\nChatGPT [2], have generated immense interest in a range\\nof domains for tasks ranging from answering questions on\\nmedical licensing exams [3] to generating code snippets. Th is\\npaper focuses on enhancing the application of LLMs in severa l\\ndomains, such as helping developers code effectively and\\nefﬁciently with unfamiliar APIs or allowing students to acq uire\\nnew coding skills and techniques.\\nLLMs are particularly promising in domains where humans\\nand AI tools work together as trustworthy collaborators to\\nmore rapidly and reliably evolve software-reliant systems [4].\\nFor example, LLMs are being integrated directly into softwa re\\ntools, such as Github’s Co-Pilot [5]–[7] and included in int e-\\ngrated development environments (IDEs), such as IntelliJ [ 8]\\nand Visual Studio Code, thereby allowing software teams to\\naccess these tools directly from their preferred IDE.\\nA prompt [9] is a set of instructions provided to an\\nLLM that programs the LLM by customizing it and/or en-\\nhancing or reﬁning its capabilities . A prompt can inﬂuence\\nsubsequent interactions with—and output generated from—a nLLM by providing speciﬁc rules and guidelines for an LLM\\nconversation with a set of initial rules. In particular, a pr ompt\\nsets the context for the conversation and tells the LLM what\\ninformation is important and what the desired output form an d\\ncontent should be.\\nFor example, a prompt could specify that an LLM should\\nonly generate code that follows a certain coding style or\\nprogramming paradigm. Likewise, it could specify that an\\nLLM should ﬂag certain keywords or phrases in a generated\\ndocument and provide additional information related to tho se\\nkeywords. By introducing these guidelines, prompts facili tate\\nmore structured and nuanced outputs to aid a large variety of\\nsoftware engineering tasks in the context of LLMs.\\nPrompt engineering is the means by which LLMs are\\nprogrammed via prompts. To demonstrate the power of\\nprompt engineering, we provide the following prompt:\\nPrompt: “From now on, I would like you to ask me\\nquestions to deploy a Python application to AWS.\\nWhen you have enough information to deploy the\\napplication, create a Python script to automate the\\ndeployment.”\\nThis example prompt causes ChatGPT to begin asking the\\nuser questions about their software application. ChatGPT w ill\\ndrive the question-asking process until it reaches a point w here\\nit has sufﬁcient information to generate a Python script tha t\\nautomates deployment. This example demonstrates the pro-\\ngramming potential of prompts beyond conventional “genera te\\na method that does X” style prompts or “answer this quiz\\nquestion”.\\nMoreover, prompts can be engineered to program an LLM\\nto accomplish much more than simply dictating the output typ e\\nor ﬁltering the information provided to the model. With the\\nright prompt, it is possible to create entirely new interact ion\\nparadigms, such as having an LLM generate and give a quiz\\nassociated with a software engineering concept or tool, or\\neven simulate a Linux terminal window. Moreover, prompts\\nhave the potential for self-adaptation, suggesting other p rompts\\nto gather additional information or generate related artif acts.\\nThese advanced capabilities of prompts highlight the impor -\\ntance of engineering them to provide value beyond simple tex t\\nor code generation.\\nPrompt patterns are essential to effective prompt engi-\\nneering.

C OMPARING SOFTWARE PATTERNS\\nWITH PROMPT PATTERNS\\nThe quality of the output(s) generated by a conversational\\nLLM is directly related to the quality of the prompts provide d\\nby the user. As discussed in Section I, the prompts given to\\na conversational LLM can be used to program interactions\\nbetween a user and an LLM to better solve a variety of\\nproblems. One contribution of this paper is the framework it\\nprovides to document patterns that structure prompts to sol ve\\na range of software tasks that can be adapted to different\\ndomains.\\nThis framework is useful since it focuses on codifying\\npatterns that can be applied to help users better interact\\nwith conversational LLMs in a variety of contexts, rather\\nthan simply discussing interesting examples or domain-spe ciﬁc\\nprompts. Codifying this knowledge in pattern form enhances\\nreuse and transferability to other contexts and domains whe re\\nusers face similar—but not identical—problems.\\nThe topic of knowledge transfer has been studied exten-\\nsively in the software patterns literature [10], [11] at mul tiple\\nlevels, e.g., design, architectural, and analysis. This paper\\napplies a variant of a familiar pattern form as the basis of\\nour prompt engineering approach. Since prompts are a form\\nof programming, it is natural to document them in pattern\\nform.\\nA. Overview of Software Patterns\\nA software pattern provides a reusable solution to a recur-\\nring problem within a particular context [10]. Documenting\\nsoftware patterns concisely conveys (and generalizes) fro m\\nspeciﬁc problems being addressed to identify important for ces\\nand/or requirements that should be resolved and/or address ed\\nin successful solutions.\\nA pattern form also includes guidance on how to implement\\nthe pattern, as well as information on the trade-offs and\\nconsiderations to take into account when implementing a\\npattern. Moreover, example applications of the pattern are\\noften provided to further showcase the pattern’s utility in\\npractice. Software patterns are typically documented in astylized form to facilitate their use and understanding, su ch\\nas:\\n•A name and classiﬁcation . Each pattern has a name that\\nidentiﬁes the pattern and should be used consistently. A\\nclassiﬁcation groups patterns into broad categories, such\\nas creational, structural, or behavioral.\\n•The intent concisely conveys the purpose the pattern is\\nintended to achieve.\\n•The motivation documents the underlying problem the\\npattern is meant to solve and the importance of the\\nproblem.\\n•The structure and participants . The structure describes\\nthe different pattern participants (such as classes and\\nobjects) and how they collaborate to form a generalized\\nsolution.\\n•Example code concretely maps the pattern to some\\nunderlying programming language(s) and aids developers\\nin gaining greater insight into how that pattern can be\\napplied effectively.\\n•Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern in practice.\\nB. Overview of Prompt Patterns\\nPrompt patterns are similar to software patterns in that the y\\noffer reusable solutions to speciﬁc problems. They focus mo re\\nspeciﬁcally, however, on the context of output generation f rom\\nlarge-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Just\\nas software patterns provide a codiﬁed approach to solving\\ncommon software development challenges, prompt patterns\\nprovide a codiﬁed approach to customizing the output and\\ninteractions of LLMs.\\nBy documenting and leveraging prompt patterns in the\\ncontext of automating software development tasks, individ ual\\nusers and teams can enforce constraints on the generated\\noutput, ensure that relevant information is included, and\\nchange the format of interaction with the LLM to better\\nsolve problems they face. Prompt patterns can be viewed as a\\ncorollary to the broad corpus of general software patterns, just\\nadapted to the more speciﬁc context of LLM output generation .\\nPrompt patterns follow a similar format to classic software\\npatterns, with slight modiﬁcations to match the context of\\noutput generation with LLMs.1Each of the analogous sections\\nfor the prompt pattern form used in this paper is summarized\\nbelow:\\n•A name and classiﬁcation . The prompt pattern name\\nuniquely identiﬁes the pattern and ideally indicates the\\nproblem that is being addressed. For the classiﬁcation,\\nwe have developed a series of initial categories of pattern\\ntypes, which are summarized in Table I and include\\nOutput Customization ,Error Identiﬁcation ,Prompt\\nImprovement ,Interaction , and Context Control .\\n•The intent and context describes the problem the prompt\\npattern solves and the goals it achieves.

Speciﬁc circumstances where the improvements\\nare expected are documented.\\n•The structure and key ideas . The structure describes\\nthe fundamental contextual information, as a series of\\nkey ideas, that the prompt pattern provides to the LLM.\\nThese ideas are similar to “participants” in a software pat-\\ntern. The contextual information may be communicated\\nthrough varying wording (just as a software pattern can\\nhave variations in how it is realized in code), but should\\nhave fundamental pieces of information that form a core\\nelement of the pattern.\\n•Example implementation demonstrates how the prompt\\npattern is worded in practice.\\n•Consequences summarize the pros and cons of applying\\nthe pattern and may provide guidance on how to adapt\\nthe prompt to different contexts.\\nC. Evaluating Means for Deﬁning a Prompt Pattern’s Struc-\\nture and Ideas\\nIn software patterns, the structure and participants are\\nnormally deﬁned in terms of UML diagrams, such as structure\\ndiagrams and/or interaction diagrams. These UML diagrams\\nexplain what the participants of the pattern are and how they\\ninteract to solve the problem. In prompt patterns, somethin g\\nanalogous is needed, though UML may not be an appro-\\npriate structural documentation approach since it is inten ded\\nto describe software structures, as opposed to the ideas to\\ncommunicate in a prompt.\\nSeveral possible approaches could be used, ranging from di-\\nagrams to deﬁning grammars for a prompt language. Although\\ngrammars may seem attractive due to their formal nature, the y\\nalso incur the following challenges:\\n•The goal of prompts is to communicate knowledge in a\\nclear and concise way to conversation LLM users, who\\nmay or may not be computer scientists or programmers.\\nAs a community, we should strive to create an approach-\\nable format that communicates knowledge clearly to a\\ndiverse target audience.\\n•It is possible to phrase a prompt in many different ways.\\nIt is hard, however, to deﬁne a grammar that accurately\\nand completely expresses all the nuanced ways that\\ncomponents of a prompt could be expressed in text or\\nsymbols.\\n•Prompts fundamentally convey ideas to a conversational\\nLLM and are not simply the production of tokens for\\ninput. In particular, an idea built into a prompt pattern\\ncan be communicated in many ways and its expressionshould be at a higher-level than the underlying tokens\\nrepresenting the idea.\\n•It is possible to program an LLM to introduce novel\\nsemantics for statements and words that create new ways\\nfor communicating an idea. In contrast, grammars may\\nnot easily represent ideas that can be expressed through\\ncompletely new symbology or languages that the gram-\\nmar designer was not aware of.\\nD. A Way Forward: Fundamental Contextual Statements\\nAn open research question, therefore, is what approach is\\nmore effective than formal grammars for describing prompt\\npattern structure and ideas. We propose the concept of funda-\\nmental contextual statements , which are written descriptions\\nof the important ideas to communicate in a prompt to an LLM.\\nAn idea can be rewritten and expressed in arbitrary ways base d\\non user needs and experience. The key ideas to communicate,\\nhowever, are presented to the user as a series of simple, but\\nfundamental, statements.\\nOne beneﬁt of adopting and applying the fundamental con-\\ntextual statements approach is that it is intentionally int uitive\\nto users. In particular, we expect users will understand how to\\nexpress and adapt the statements in a contextually appropri ate\\nway for their domain. Moreover, since the underlying ideas o f\\nthe prompt are captured, these same ideas can be expressed\\nby the user in alternate symbology or wording that has been\\nintroduced to the LLM using patterns, such as the Meta\\nLanguage Creation pattern presented in Section III-B.\\nOur ultimate goal is to enhance prompt engineering by\\nproviding a framework for designing prompts that can be\\nreused and/or adapted to other LLMs in the same way that\\nsoftware patterns can be implemented in different program-\\nming languages and platforms. For the purposes of this paper ,\\nhowever, all prompts were tested with ChatGPT [12] using the\\nChatGPT+ service. We use ChatGPT as the LLM for all exam-\\nples presented in this paper due to its widespread availabil ity\\nand popularity. These examples were documented through a\\ncombination of exploring the corpus of community-posted\\nprompts on the Internet and independent prompt creation fro m\\nour use of ChatGPT to automating software development\\ntasks.\\nIII. A C ATALOG OF PROMPT PATTERNS\\nFOR CONVERSATIONAL LLM S\\nThis section presents our catalog of prompt patterns that\\nhave been applied to solve common problems in the domain\\nof conversational LLM interaction and output generation fo r\\nautomating software tasks. Each prompt pattern is accompa-\\nnied by concrete implementation samples and examples with\\nand without the prompt.\\nA. Summary of the Prompt Pattern Catalog\\nThe classiﬁcation of prompt patterns is an important consid -\\neration in documenting the patterns. Table I outlines the in itial\\nclassiﬁcations for the catalog of prompt patterns we identi ﬁed\\nin our work with ChatGPT thus far.', doc_id='147832ac-91e3-4114-b36a-ced1e450d7b3', embedding=None, doc_hash='43d20feae5909d977d81a65436413db61baf17038b5a7a14fe4f0cd223ff53bf', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='TABLE I\\nCLASSIFYING PROMPT PATTERNS\\nPattern Category Prompt Pattern\\nInput Semantics Meta Language Creation\\nOutput Output Automater\\nCustomization Persona\\nVisualization Generator\\nRecipe\\nTemplate\\nError Identiﬁcation Fact Check List\\nReﬂection\\nPrompt Question Reﬁnement\\nImprovement Alternative Approaches\\nCognitive Veriﬁer\\nRefusal Breaker\\nInteraction Flipped Interaction\\nGame Play\\nInﬁnite Generation\\nContext Control Context Manager\\nAs shown in this table, there are ﬁve categories of prompt\\npatterns in our classiﬁcation framework: Input Semantics ,\\nOutput Customization ,Error Identiﬁcation ,Prompt Im-\\nprovement , and Interaction , each of which is summarized\\nbelow.\\nThe Input Semantics category deals with how an LLM\\nunderstands the input and how it translates the input into\\nsomething it can use to generate output. This category in-\\ncludes the Meta Language Creation pattern, which focuses on\\ncreating a custom language for the LLM to understand. This\\npattern is useful when the default input language is ill-sui ted\\nfor expressing ideas the user wants to convey to the LLM.\\nTheOutput Customization category focuses on constrain-\\ning or tailoring the types, formats, structure, or other pro perties\\nof the output generated by the LLM. The prompt patterns in\\nthis category include Output Automater ,Persona ,Visualiza-\\ntion Generator ,Recipe , and Template patterns. The Output\\nAutomater pattern allows the user to create scripts that can\\nautomate any tasks the LLM output suggests the user should\\nperform. The Persona pattern gives the LLM a persona or role\\nto play when generating output. The Visualization Generator\\npattern allows the user to generate visualizations by produ cing\\ntextual outputs that can be fed to other tools, such as other\\nAI-based image generators, like DALL-E [13]. The Recipe\\npattern allows the user to obtain a sequence of steps or actio ns\\nto realize a stated end result, possibly with partially know n\\ninformation or constraints. The Template pattern allows the\\nuser to specify a template for the output, which the LLM ﬁlls\\nin with content.\\nThe Error Identiﬁcation category focuses on identifying\\nand resolving errors in the output generated by the LLM. Thiscategory includes the Fact Check List andReﬂection patterns.\\nThe Fact Check List pattern requires the LLM to generate a\\nlist of facts the output depends on that should be fact-check ed.\\nThe Reﬂection pattern requires the LLM to introspect on its\\noutput and identify any errors.\\nThe Prompt Improvement category focuses on improving\\nthe quality of the input and output. This category includes\\ntheQuestion Reﬁnement ,Alternative Approaches ,Cognitive\\nVeriﬁer , and Refusal Breaker patterns. The Question Reﬁne-\\nment pattern ensures the LLM always suggests a better version\\nof the user’s question. The Alternative Approaches pattern\\nrequires the LLM to suggest alternative ways of accomplishi ng\\na user-speciﬁed task. The Cognitive Veriﬁer pattern instructs\\nthe LLM to automatically suggest a series of subquestions\\nfor the user to answer before combining the answers to the\\nsubquestions and producing an answer to the overall questio n.\\nTheRefusal Breaker pattern requires the LLM to automatically\\nreword the user’s question when it refuses to produce an\\nanswer.\\nThe Interaction category focuses on the interaction be-\\ntween the user and the LLM. This category includes the\\nFlipped Interaction ,Game Play , and Inﬁnite Generation pat-\\nterns. The Flipped Interaction pattern requires the LLM to\\nask questions rather than generate output. The Game Play\\npattern requires the LLM to generate output in the form of\\na game. The Inﬁnite Generation pattern requires the LLM to\\ngenerate output indeﬁnitely without the user having to reen ter\\nthe generator prompt each time.\\nFinally, the Context Control category focuses on control-\\nling the contextual information in which the LLM operates.\\nThis category includes the Context Manager pattern, which\\nallows the user to specify the context for the LLM’s output.\\nThe remainder of this section describes each of these prompt\\npatterns using the pattern form discussed in Section II-B.\\nB. The Meta Language Creation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: During a conversation with an LLM,\\nthe user would like to create the prompt via an alternate\\nlanguage, such as a textual short-hand notation for graphs, a\\ndescription of states and state transitions for a state mach ine, a\\nset of commands for prompt automation, etc. The intent of thi s\\npattern is to explain the semantics of this alternative lang uage\\nto the LLM so the user can write future prompts using this\\nnew language and its semantics.\\n2) Motivation: Many problems, structures, or other ideas\\ncommunicated in a prompt may be more concisely, unam-\\nbiguously, or clearly expressed in a language other than\\nEnglish (or whatever conventional human language is used\\nto interact with an LLM). To produce output based on an\\nalternative language, however, an LLM needs to understand\\nthe language’s semantics.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen I say X, I mean Y (or would like you to do Y)', doc_id='635b861d-d2bb-4b21-a19b-8679abb432d8', embedding=None, doc_hash='000d96583f3ba45b2481d2f1e8db97e9e3b379794fe73e22128508833154ee6a', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='The key structure of this pattern involves explaining the\\nmeaning of one or more symbols, words, or statements to\\nthe LLM so it uses the provided semantics for the ensuing\\nconversation. This description can take the form of a simple\\ntranslation, such as “X” means “Y”. The description can also\\ntake more complex forms that deﬁne a series of commands\\nand their semantics, such as “when I say X, I want you to do\\n”. In this case, “X” is henceforth bound to the semantics of\\n“take action”.\\n4) Example Implementation: The key to successfully using\\ntheMeta Language Creation pattern is developing an unam-\\nbiguous notation or shorthand, such as the following:\\n“From now on, whenever I type two identiﬁers\\nseparated by a “ →”, I am describing a graph. For\\nexample, “a →b” is describing a graph with nodes\\n“a” and “b” and an edge between them. If I separate\\nidentiﬁers by “-[w:2, z:3] →”, I am adding properties\\nof the edge, such as a weight or label.”\\nThis example of the Meta Language Creation pattern estab-\\nlishes a standardized notation for describing graphs by deﬁ ning\\na convention for representing nodes and edges. Whenever the\\nauthor types two identiﬁers separated by a “ →” symbol, it is\\nan indication that a graph is being described. For example, i f\\nthe author types “a →b”, this indicates that a graph is being\\ndeﬁned with nodes “a” and “b”, and that there is an edge\\nbetween them. This convention provides a clear and concise\\nway to communicate the structure of a graph in written form.\\nMoreover, the prompt goes on to specify that additional\\ninformation about the edges, such as a weight or label, can\\nbe provided using the syntax “-[w:2, z:3] →”. This notation\\nallows for the speciﬁcation of additional properties beyon d\\nthe basic structure of the graph. The speciﬁed properties ar e\\nassociated with the edge between the two nodes and can\\nprovide important context for the interpretation of the gra ph.\\nThis standardized notation for describing graphs can make i t\\neasier to communicate graph structures and properties, whi ch\\nmay not be easy or are very verbose to describe as a series of\\nsentences.\\n5) Consequences: Although this pattern provides a pow-\\nerful means to customize a user’s interaction with an LLM,\\nit may create the potential for confusion within the LLM.\\nAs important as it is to clearly deﬁne the semantics of the\\nlanguage, it is also essential to ensure the language itself\\nintroduces no ambiguities that degrade the LLM’s performan ce\\nor accuracy. For example, the prompt “whenever I separate\\ntwo things by commas, it means that the ﬁrst thing precedes\\nthe second thing” will likely create signiﬁcant potential f or\\nambiguity and create the potential for unexpected semantic s\\nif punctuation involving commas is used in the prompt.\\nTo showcase the potential for confusion, ChatGPT will\\nwarn the user and potentially be unable to perform a speciﬁc\\nmapping of a symbol or term to a new meaning. For example,\\nif following prompt is given to ChatGPT\\n“Whenever I say “a”, I am referring to Marie An-\\ntoinette.”it will respond that this prompt creates too much confusion\\nas “a” is an indeﬁnite article and too commonly used, as shown\\nbelow:\\n“Referring to Marie Antoinette using “a” could\\npotentially cause confusion, as “a” is an indeﬁnite\\narticle commonly used to refer to a noun that has\\nnot been mentioned before. It may be more clear\\nto use her name, “Marie Antoinette”, or a pronoun\\nsuch as “she” or “her” to refer to her. Moreover,\\nusing context to establish who you are referring to\\ncan also help avoid confusion in conversation.”\\nIn general, an LLM will perform better on data it was\\ntrained on. Therefore, when an existing notation is availab le—\\nbut may not be the dominant meaning—the Meta Language\\nCreation pattern can provide context to scope the meaning of\\nthe symbol to improve the accurately and utility of the outpu t.\\nFor example, the symbol “ →” conveys slightly different infor-\\nmation in graphs and propositional logic. The statement “p →\\nq, q→p” may therefore make sense, but only if the LLM\\nis given the appropriate context through a Meta Language\\nCreation prompt.\\nAlthough Meta Language Creation is a powerful pattern it\\nmust be used carefully, particularly when describing conce pts\\nthat may otherwise be hard to precisely or concisely describ e.\\nThese types of prompts are thus best used in completely\\nnew conversation sessions. Using a single meta-language-p er-\\nconversation session may also be a best practice since it avo ids\\nthe potential for conﬂicting or unexpected semantics being\\napplied to the conversation over time.\\nC. The Output Automater Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to have\\nthe LLM generate a script or other automation artifact that c an\\nautomatically perform any steps it recommends taking as par t\\nof its output. The goal is to reduce the manual effort needed\\nto implement any LLM output recommendations.\\n2) Motivation: The output of an LLM is often a sequence\\nof steps for the user to follow. For example, when asking an\\nLLM to generate a Python conﬁguration script it may suggest\\na number of ﬁles to modify and changes to apply to each ﬁle.\\nHowever, having users continually perform the manual steps\\ndictated by LLM output is tedious and error-prone.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you produce an output that has at least one\\nstep to take and the following properties (alternatively,\\nalways do this)\\nProduce an executable artifact of type X that will\\nautomate these steps\\nThe ﬁrst part of the pattern identiﬁes the situations under\\nwhich automation should be generated. A simple approach\\nis to state that the output includes at least two steps to\\ntake and that an automation artifact should be produced.

The scope can be\\nlimited to outputs requiring more than a certain number of\\nsteps.\\nThe next part of this pattern provides a concrete statement\\nof the type of output the LLM should output to perform the\\nautomation. For example, “produce a Python script” gives th e\\nLLM a concrete understanding to translate the general steps\\ninto equivalent steps in Python. The automation artifact sh ould\\nbe concrete and must be something that the LLM associates\\nwith the action of “automating a sequence of steps”.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample of this prompt pat-\\ntern applied to code snippets generated by the ChatGPT LLM\\nis shown below:\\n“From now on, whenever you generate code that\\nspans more than one ﬁle, generate a Python script\\nthat can be run to automatically create the speciﬁed\\nﬁles or make changes to existing ﬁles to insert the\\ngenerated code.”\\nThis pattern is particularly effective in software enginee ring\\nas a common task for software engineers using LLMs is to\\nthen copy/paste the outputs into multiple ﬁles. Some tools,\\nsuch as Copilot, insert limited snippets directly into the s ection\\nof code that the coder is working with, but tools, such as\\nChatGPT, do not provide these facilities. This automation t rick\\nis also effective at creating scripts for running commands o n\\na terminal, automating cloud operations, or reorganizing ﬁ les\\non a ﬁle system.\\nThis pattern is a powerful complement for any system that\\ncan be computer controlled. The LLM can provide a set of\\nsteps that should be taken on the computer-controlled syste m\\nand then the output can be translated into a script that allow s\\nthe computer controlling the system to automatically take\\nthe steps. This is a direct pathway to allowing LLMs, such\\nas ChatGPT, to integrate quality into—and to control—new\\ncomputing systems that have a known scripting interface.\\n5) Consequences: An important usage consideration of\\nthis pattern is that the automation artifact must be deﬁned\\nconcretely. Without a concrete meaning for how to “automate ”\\nthe steps, the LLM often states that it “can’t automate thing s”\\nsince that is beyond its capabilities. LLMs typically accep t\\nrequests to produce code, however, so the goal is to instruct the\\nLLM to generate text/code, which can be executed to automate\\nsomething. This subtle distinction in meaning is important to\\nhelp an LLM disambiguate the prompt meaning.\\nOne caveat of the Output Automater pattern is the LLM\\nneeds sufﬁcient conversational context to generate an auto ma-\\ntion artifact that is functional in the target context, such as\\nthe ﬁle system of a project on a Mac vs. Windows computer.\\nThis pattern works best when the full context needed for the\\nautomation is contained within the conversation, e.g., when\\na software application is generated from scratch using the\\nconversation and all actions on the local ﬁle system are\\nperformed using a sequence of generated automation artifac tsrather than manual actions unknown to the LLM. Alternativel y,\\nself-contained sequences of steps work well, such as “how do\\nI ﬁnd the list of open ports on my Mac computer”.\\nIn some cases, the LLM may produce a long output with\\nmultiple steps and not include an automation artifact. This\\nomission may arise for various reasons, including exceedin g\\nthe output length limitation the LLM supports. A simple\\nworkaround for this situation is to remind the LLM via a\\nfollow-on prompt, such as “But you didn’t automate it”, whic h\\nprovides the context that the automation artifact was omitt ed\\nand should be generated.\\nAt this point in the evolution of LLMs, the Output Auto-\\nmater pattern is best employed by users who can read and\\nunderstand the generated automation artifact. LLMs can (an d\\ndo) produce inaccuracies in their output, so blindly accept ing\\nand executing an automation artifact carries signiﬁcant ri sk.\\nAlthough this pattern may alleviate the user from performin g\\ncertain manual steps, it does not alleviate their responsib ility\\nto understand the actions they undertake using the output.\\nWhen users execute automation scripts, therefore they assu me\\nresponsibility for the outcomes.\\nD. The Flipped Interaction Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: You want the LLM to ask questions\\nto obtain the information it needs to perform some tasks.\\nRather than the user driving the conversation, therefore, y ou\\nwant the LLM to drive the conversation to focus it on\\nachieving a speciﬁc goal. For example, you may want the\\nLLM to give you a quick quiz or automatically ask questions\\nuntil it has sufﬁcient information to generate a deployment\\nscript for your application to a particular cloud environme nt.\\n2) Motivation: Rather than having the user drives a con-\\nversation, an LLM often has knowledge it can use to more\\naccurately obtain information from the user. The goal of the\\nFlipped Interaction pattern is to ﬂip the interaction ﬂow so the\\nLLM asks the user questions to achieve some desired goal. The\\nLLM can often better select the format, number, and content\\nof the interactions to ensure that the goal is reached faster ,\\nmore accurately, and/or by using knowledge the user may not\\n(initially) possess.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to ask me questions to achieve X\\nYou should ask questions until this condition is met or\\nto achieve this goal (alternatively, forever)\\n(Optional) ask me the questions one at a time, two at\\na time, etc.\\nA prompt for a ﬂipped interaction should always specify the\\ngoal of the interaction. The ﬁrst idea ( i.e., you want the LLM to\\nask questions to achieve a goal) communicates this goal to th e\\nLLM. Equally important is that the questions should focus on a\\nparticular topic or outcome. By providing the goal, the LLM\\ncan understand what it is trying to accomplish through the\\ninteraction and tailor its questions accordingly. This “in version', doc_id='0d3b6cd3-1961-4891-8907-5b6bf43cd207', embedding=None, doc_hash='1d6f99c4b35e38b563ab635e73e7b1e19284c7595891cc6485bfa4566e4f9454', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='of control” enables more focused and efﬁcient interaction s ince\\nthe LLM will only ask questions that it deems relevant to\\nachieving the speciﬁed goal.\\nThe second idea provides the context for how long the in-\\nteraction should occur. A ﬂipped interaction can be termina ted\\nwith a response like “stop asking questions”. It is often bet ter,\\nhowever, to scope the interaction to a reasonable length or\\nonly as far as is needed to reach the goal. This goal can be\\nsurprisingly open-ended and the LLM will continue to work\\ntowards the goal by asking questions, as is the case in the\\nexample of ”until you have enough information to generate a\\nPython script”.\\nBy default, the LLM is likely to generate multiple questions\\nper iteration. The third idea is completely optional, but ca n\\nimprove usability by limiting (or expanding) the number of\\nquestions that the LLM generates per cycle. If a precise\\nnumber/format for the questioning is not speciﬁed, the ques -\\ntioning will be semi-random and may lead to one-at-a-time\\nquestions or ten-at-a-time questions. The prompt can thus b e\\ntailored to include the number of questions asked at a time,\\nthe order of the questions, and any other formatting/orderi ng\\nconsiderations to facilitate user interaction.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample prompt for a ﬂipped\\ninteraction is shown below:\\n“From now on, I would like you to ask me questions\\nto deploy a Python application to AWS. When you\\nhave enough information to deploy the application,\\ncreate a Python script to automate the deployment.”\\nIn general, the more speciﬁc the prompt regarding the\\nconstraints and information to collect, the better the outc ome.\\nFor instance, the example prompt above could provide a menu\\nof possible AWS services (such as Lambda, EC2, etc.) with\\nwhich to deploy the application. In other cases, the LLM may\\nbe permitted to simply make appropriate choices on its own fo r\\nthings that the user doesn’t explicitly make decisions abou t.\\nOne limitation of this prompt is that, once other contextual\\ninformation is provided regarding the task, it may require\\nexperimentation with the precise phrasing to get the LLM to\\nask the questions in the appropriate number and ﬂow to best\\nsuit the task, such as asking multiple questions at once vers us\\none question at a time.\\n5) Consequences: One consideration when designing the\\nprompt is how much to dictate to the LLM regarding what\\ninformation to collect prior to termination. In the example\\nabove, the ﬂipped interaction is open-ended and can vary sig -\\nniﬁcantly in the ﬁnal generated artifact. This open-endedn ess\\nmakes the prompt generic and reusable, but may potentially\\nask additional questions that could be skipped if more conte xt\\nis given.\\nIf speciﬁc requirements are known in advance, it is better to\\ninject them into the prompt rather than hoping the LLM will\\nobtain the needed information. Otherwise, the LLM will non-\\nnondeterministically decide whether to prompt the user for the\\ninformation or make an educated guess as to an appropriate\\nvalue.For example, the user can state that they would like to\\ndeploy an application to Amazon AWS EC2, rather than\\nsimply state ”the cloud” and require multiple interactions to\\nnarrow down the deployment target. The more precise the\\ninitial information, the better the LLM can use the limited\\nquestions that a user is likely willing to answer to obtain\\ninformation to improve its output.\\nWhen developing prompts for ﬂipped interactions, it is im-\\nportant to consider the level of user knowledge, engagement ,\\nand control. If the goal is to accomplish the goal with as litt le\\nuser interaction as possible (minimal control), that shoul d be\\nstated explicitly.Conversely, if the goal is to ensure the u ser\\nis aware of all key decisions and conﬁrms them (maximum\\nengagement) that should also be stated explicitly. Likewis e, if\\nthe user is expected to have minimal knowledge and should\\nhave the questions targeted at their level of expertise, thi s\\ninformation should be engineered into the prompt.\\nE. The Persona Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: In many cases, users would like\\nLLM output to always take a certain point of view or per-\\nspective. For example, it may be useful for to conduct a code\\nreview as if the LLM was a security expert. The intent of this\\npattern is to give the LLM a “persona” that helps it select wha t\\ntypes of output to generate and what details to focus on.\\n2) Motivation: Users may not know what types of outputs\\nor details are important for an LLM to focus on to achieve\\na given task. They may know, however, the role or type of\\nperson that they would normally ask to get help with these\\nthings. The Persona pattern enables the users to express what\\nthey need help with without knowing the exact details of the\\noutputs they need.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nAct as persona X\\nProvide outputs that persona X would create\\nThe ﬁrst statement conveys the idea that the LLM needs\\nto act as a speciﬁc persona and provide outputs that such a\\npersona would. This persona can be expressed in a number\\nof ways, ranging from a job description, title, ﬁctional cha r-\\nacter, historical ﬁgure, etc. The persona should elicit a se t\\nof attributes associated with a well-known job title, type o f\\nperson, etc.2\\nThe secondary idea—provide outputs that persona X would\\ncreate—offers opportunities for customization. For examp le, a\\nteacher might provide a large variety of different output ty pes,\\nranging from assignments to reading lists to lectures. If a m ore\\nspeciﬁc scope to the type of output is known, the user can\\nprovide it in this statement.\\n2Be aware, however, that personas relating to living people o r people\\nconsidered harmful make be disregarded due to underlying LL M privacy and\\nsecurity rules.', doc_id='8b5fe526-e1ce-49d7-970e-360d94a58580', embedding=None, doc_hash='f67b5e5bc87de7429256da95d6cc068e3107879586ed0ea97e226c3bd3e2ea91', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='4) Example Implementation: A sample implementation for\\ncode review is shown below:\\n“From now on, act as a security reviewer. Pay close\\nattention to the security details of any code that\\nwe look at. Provide outputs that a security reviewer\\nwould regarding the code.”\\nIn this example, the LLM is instructed to provide outputs\\nthat a ”security reviewer” would. The prompt further sets th e\\nstage that code is going to be evaluated. Finally, the user\\nreﬁnes the persona by scoping the persona further to outputs\\nregarding the code.\\nPersonas can also represent inanimate or non-human en-\\ntities, such as a Linux terminal, a database, or an animal’s\\nperspective. When using this pattern to represent these ent ities,\\nit can be useful to also specify how you want the inputs\\ndelivered to the entity, such as “assume my input is what the\\nowner is saying to the dog and your output is the sounds the\\ndog is making”. An example prompt for a non-human entity\\nthat uses a “pretend to be” wording is shown below:\\n“You are going to pretend to be a Linux terminal\\nfor a computer that has been compromised by an\\nattacker. When I type in a command, you are going\\nto output the corresponding text that the Linux\\nterminal would produce.”\\nThis prompt is designed to simulate a computer that has\\nbeen compromised by an attacker and is being controlled\\nthrough a Linux terminal. The prompt speciﬁes that the user\\nwill input commands into the terminal, and in response, the\\nsimulated terminal will output the corresponding text that\\nwould be produced by a real Linux terminal. This prompt\\nis more prescriptive in the persona and asks the LLM to, not\\nonly be a Linux terminal, but to further act as a computer that\\nhas been compromised by an attacker.\\nThe persona causes ChatGPT to generate outputs to com-\\nmands that have ﬁles and contents indicative of a computer th at\\nwas hacked. The example illustrates how an LLM can bring\\nits situational awareness to a persona, in this case, creati ng\\nevidence of a cyberattack in the outputs it generates. This\\ntype of persona can be very effective for combining with the\\nGame Play pattern, where you want the exact details of the\\noutput characteristics to be hidden from the user (e.g., don ’t\\ngive away what the cyberattack did by describing it explicit ly\\nin the prompt).\\n5) Consequences: An interesting aspect of taking non-\\nhuman personas is that the LLM may make interesting as-\\nsumptions or “hallucinations” regarding the context. A wid ely\\ncirculated example on the Internet asks ChatGPT to act as\\na Linux terminal and produce the expected output that you\\nwould get if the user typed the same text into a terminal.\\nCommands, such as ls -l , will generate a ﬁle listing for an\\nimaginary UNIX ﬁle system, complete with ﬁles that can have\\ncat file1.txt run on them.\\nIn other examples, the LLM may prompt the user for more\\ncontext, such as when ChatGPT is asked to act as a MySQL\\ndatabase and prompts for the structure of a table that the use ris pretending to query. ChatGPT can then generate synthetic\\nrows, such as generating imaginary rows for a “people” table\\nwith columns for “name” and “job”.\\nF . The Question Reﬁnement Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern engages the LLM in\\nthe prompt engineering process. The intent of this pattern i s\\nto ensure the conversational LLM always suggests potential ly\\nbetter or more reﬁned questions the user could ask instead of\\ntheir original question. Using this pattern, the LLM can aid the\\nuser in ﬁnding the right question to ask in order to arrive at a n\\naccurate answer. In addition, the LLM may help the user ﬁnd\\nthe information or achieve their goal in fewer interactions with\\nthe user than if the user employed trial and error prompting.\\n2) Motivation: If a user is asking a question, it is possible\\nthey are not an expert in the domain and may not know the\\nbest way to phrase the question or be aware of additional\\ninformation helpful in phrasing the question. LLMs will oft en\\nstate limitations on the answer they are providing or reques t\\nadditional information to help them produce a more accurate\\nanswer. An LLM may also state assumptions it made in\\nproviding the answer. The motivation is that this additiona l\\ninformation or set of assumptions could be used to generate\\na better prompt. Rather than requiring the user to digest\\nand rephrase their prompt with the additional information,\\nthe LLM can directly reﬁne the prompt to incorporate the\\nadditional information.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, suggest a better version of the question\\nto use instead\\n(Optional) prompt me if I would like to use the better\\nversion instead\\nThe ﬁrst contextual statement in the prompt is asking the\\nLLM to suggest a better version of a question within a speciﬁc\\nscope. The scope is provided to ensure that not all questions\\nare automatically reworded or that they are reﬁned with a\\ngiven goal. The second contextual statement is meant for\\nautomation and allows the user to automatically use the reﬁn ed\\nquestion without having to copy/paste or manually enter it. The\\nengineering of this prompt can be further reﬁned by combinin g\\nit with the Reﬂection pattern, which allows the LLM to explain\\nwhy it believes the reﬁned question is an improvement.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question about a\\nsoftware artifact’s security, suggest a better version\\nof the question to use that incorporates information\\nspeciﬁc to security risks in the language or frame-\\nwork that I am using instead and ask me if I would\\nlike to use your question instead.”\\nIn the context of the example above, the LLM will use\\ntheQuestion Reﬁnement pattern to improve security-related\\nquestions by asking for or using speciﬁc details about the', doc_id='01356be7-d8ed-48f3-b22e-ee529b03f7f8', embedding=None, doc_hash='21c78889980f53991f4cd3fea45ad3f9a6a091529a3e7b55bd7c8223d0e34d79', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='software artifact and the language or framework used to buil d\\nit. For instance, if a developer of a Python web application w ith\\nFastAPI asks ChatGPT “How do I handle user authentication\\nin my web application?”, the LLM will reﬁne the question\\nby taking into account that the web application is written in\\nPython with FastAPI. The LLM then provides a revised ques-\\ntion that is more speciﬁc to the language and framework, such\\nas “What are the best practices for handling user authentica tion\\nsecurely in a FastAPI web application to mitigate common\\nsecurity risks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross- site\\nrequest forgery (CSRF), and session hijacking?”\\nThe additional detail in the revised question is likely\\nto not only make the user aware of issues they need to\\nconsider, but lead to a better answer from the LLM. For\\nsoftware engineering tasks, this pattern could also incorp orate\\ninformation regarding potential bugs, modularity, or othe r\\ncode quality considerations. Another approach would be to\\nautomatically reﬁne questions so the generated code cleanl y\\nseparates concerns or minimizes use of external libraries, such\\nas:\\nWhenever I ask a question about how to write some\\ncode, suggest a better version of my question that\\nasks how to write the code in a way that minimizes\\nmy dependencies on external libraries.\\n5) Consequences: The Question Reﬁnement pattern helps\\nbridge the gap between the user’s knowledge and the LLM’s\\nunderstanding, thereby yielding more efﬁcient and accurat e\\ninteractions. One risk of this pattern is its tendency to rap idly\\nnarrow the questioning by the user into a speciﬁc area that\\nguides the user down a more limited path of inquiry than\\nnecessary. The consequence of this narrowing is that the\\nuser may miss important ”bigger picture” information. One\\nsolution to this problem is to provide additional scope to th e\\npattern prompt, such as “do not scope my questions to speciﬁc\\nprogramming languages or frameworks.”\\nAnother approach to overcoming arbitrary narrowing or\\nlimited targeting of the reﬁned question is to combine the\\nQuestion Reﬁnement pattern with other patterns. In particular,\\nthis pattern can be combined with the Cognitive Veriﬁer pattern\\nso the LLM automatically produces a series of follow-up ques -\\ntions that can produce the reﬁned question. For example, in\\nthe following prompt the Question Reﬁnement andCognitive\\nVeriﬁer patterns are applied to ensure better questions are\\nposed to the LLM:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion.”\\nAs with many patterns that allow an LLM to generate\\nnew questions using its knowledge, the LLM may introduce\\nunfamiliar terms or concepts to the user into the question.\\nOne way to address this issue is to include a statement that\\nthe LLM should explain any unfamiliar terms it introduces in to\\nthe question. A further enhancement of this idea is to combin etheQuestion Reﬁnement pattern with the Persona pattern so\\nthe LLM ﬂags terms and generates deﬁnitions that assume a\\nparticular level of knowledge, such as this example:\\n“From now on, whenever I ask a question, ask four\\nadditional questions that would help you produce a\\nbetter version of my original question. Then, use my\\nanswers to suggest a better version of my original\\nquestion. After the follow-up questions, temporarily\\nact as a user with no knowledge of AWS and deﬁne\\nany terms that I need to know to accurately answer\\nthe questions.”\\nAn LLM can always produce factual inaccuracies, just\\nlike a human. A risk of this pattern is that the inaccuracies\\nare introduced into the reﬁned question. This risk may be\\nmitigated, however, by combining the Fact Check List pattern\\nto enable the user to identify possible inaccuracies and the\\nReﬂection pattern to explain the reasoning behind the question\\nreﬁnement.\\nG. The Alternative Approaches Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to ensure\\nan LLM always offers alternative ways of accomplishing a tas k\\nso a user does not pursue only the approaches with which they\\nare familiar. The LLM can provide alternative approaches th at\\nalways force the user to think about what they are doing and\\ndetermine if that is the best approach to meet reach their goa l.\\nIn addition, solving the task may inform the user or teach the m\\nabout alternative concepts for subsequent follow-up.\\n2) Motivation: Humans often suffer from cognitive biases\\nthat lead them to choose a particular approach to solve a\\nproblem even when it is not the right or “best” approach.\\nMoreover, humans may be unaware of alternative approaches\\nto what they have used in the past. The motivation of the\\nAlternative Approaches pattern is to ensure the user is aware\\nof alternative approaches to select a better approach to sol ve\\na problem by dissolving their cognitive biases.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X, if there are alternative ways to accom-\\nplish the same thing, list the best alternate approaches\\n(Optional) compare/contrast the pros and cons of each\\napproach\\n(Optional) include the original way that I asked\\n(Optional) prompt me for which approach I would like\\nto use\\nThe ﬁrst statement, “within scope X”, scopes the interactio n\\nto a particular goal, topic, or bounds on the questioning. Th e\\nscope is the constraints that the user is placing on the alter -\\nnative approaches. The scope could be “for implementation\\ndecisions” or “for the deployment of the application”. The\\nscope ensures that any alternatives ﬁt within the boundarie s\\nor constraints that the user must adhere to.\\nThe second statement, “if there are alternative ways to\\naccomplish the same thing, list the best alternate approach es”', doc_id='ddb7128a-86ad-4c4d-9223-a59a6343f7fa', embedding=None, doc_hash='099a84568fbde3987575773f6630f72dca898aa83e210226d73500c6fd79bcc6', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='instructs the LLM to suggest alternatives. As with other\\npatterns, the speciﬁcity of the instructions can be increas ed or\\ninclude domain-speciﬁc contextual information. For examp le,\\nthe statement could be scoped to “if there are alternative wa ys\\nto accomplish the same thing with the software framework tha t\\nI am using” to prevent the LLM from suggesting alternatives\\nthat are inherently non-viable because they would require t oo\\nmany changes to other parts of the application.\\nSince the user may not be aware of the alternative ap-\\nproaches, they also may not be aware of why one would\\nchoose one of the alternatives. The optional statement “com -\\npare/contrast the pros and cons of each approach” adds de-\\ncision making criteria to the analysis. This statement ensu res\\nthe LLM will provide the user with the necessary rationale\\nfor alternative approaches. The ﬁnal statement, “prompt me\\nfor which approach I would like to use”, helps eliminate the\\nuser needing to manually copy/paste or enter in an alternati ve\\napproach if one is selected.\\n4) Example Implementation: Example prompt implementa-\\ntion to generate, compare, and allow the user to select one or\\nmore alternative approaches:\\n“Whenever I ask you to deploy an application to\\na speciﬁc cloud service, if there are alternative\\nservices to accomplish the same thing with the\\nsame cloud service provider, list the best alternative\\nservices and then compare/contrast the pros and cons\\nof each approach with respect to cost, availability,\\nand maintenance effort and include the original way\\nthat I asked. Then ask me which approach I would\\nlike to proceed with.”\\nThis implementation of the Alternative Approaches pattern\\nis being speciﬁcally tailored for the context of software\\nengineering and focuses on the deployment of applications\\nto cloud services. The prompt is intended to intercept place s\\nwhere the developer may have made a cloud service selection\\nwithout full awareness of alternative services that may be\\npriced more competitively or easier to maintain. The prompt\\ndirects ChatGPT to list the best alternative services that c an\\naccomplish the same task with the same cloud service provide r\\n(providing constraints on the alternatives), and to compar e and\\ncontrast the pros and cons of each approach.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern is effective in its generic\\nform and can be applied to a range of tasks effectively.\\nReﬁnements could include having a standardized catalog of\\nacceptable alternatives in a speciﬁc domain from which the\\nuser must select. The Alternative Approaches pattern can also\\nbe used to incentivize users to select one of an approved set\\nof approaches while informing them of the pros/cons of the\\napproved options.\\nH. The Cognitive Veriﬁer Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: Research literature has documented\\nthat LLMs can often reason better if a question is subdivided\\ninto additional questions that provide answers combined in to\\nthe overall answer to the original question [14]. The intent of\\nthe pattern is to force the LLM to always subdivide questionsinto additional questions that can be used to provide a bette r\\nanswer to the original question.\\n2) Motivation: The motivation of the Cognitive Veriﬁer\\npattern is two-fold:\\n•Humans may initially ask questions that are too high-\\nlevel to provide a concrete answer to without additional\\nfollow-up due to unfamiliarity with the domain, laziness\\nin prompt entry, or being unsure about what the correct\\nphrasing of the question should be.\\n•Research has demonstrated that LLMs can often perform\\nbetter when using a question that is subdivided into\\nindividual questions.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhen you are asked a question, follow these rules\\nGenerate a number of additional questions that would\\nhelp more accurately answer the question\\nCombine the answers to the individual questions to\\nproduce the ﬁnal answer to the overall question\\nThe ﬁrst statement is to generate a number of additional\\nquestions that would help more accurately answer the origin al\\nquestion. This step instructs the LLM to consider the contex t\\nof the question and to identify any information that may be\\nmissing or unclear. By generating additional questions, th e\\nLLM can help to ensure that the ﬁnal answer is as complete\\nand accurate as possible. This step also encourages critica l\\nthinking by the user and can help to uncover new insights or\\napproaches that may not have been considered initially, whi ch\\nsubsequently lead to better follow-on questions.\\nThe second statement is to combine the answers to the\\nindividual questions to produce the ﬁnal answer to the overa ll\\nquestion. This step is designed to ensure that all of the info r-\\nmation gathered from the individual questions is incorpora ted\\ninto the ﬁnal answer. By combining the answers, the LLM\\ncan provide a more comprehensive and accurate response to\\nthe original question. This step also helps to ensure that al l\\nrelevant information is taken into account and that the ﬁnal\\nanswer is not based on any single answer.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“When I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. When I have answered the three\\nquestions, combine the answers to produce the ﬁnal\\nanswers to my original question.”\\nThis speciﬁc instance of the prompt pattern adds a reﬁne-\\nment to the original pattern by specifying a set number of\\nadditional questions that the LLM should generate in respon se\\nto a question. In this case, the prompt speciﬁes that ChatGPT\\nshould generate three additional questions that would help to\\ngive a more accurate answer to the original question. The\\nspeciﬁc number can be based on the user’s experience and\\nwillingness to provide follow-up information. A reﬁnement\\nto the prompt can be to provide a context for the amount', doc_id='8f373cc3-17f7-40e2-923a-82d79dcc491c', embedding=None, doc_hash='690d8a77918edd0d281c36761c67f1d463728ddbd9419e3fbe5f703ccd3389cc', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='of knowledge that the LLM can assume the user has in the\\ndomain to guide the creation of the additional questions:\\n“When I ask you a question, generate three addi-\\ntional questions that would help you give a more\\naccurate answer. Assume that I know little about\\nthe topic that we are discussing and please deﬁne\\nany terms that are not general knowledge. When\\nI have answered the three questions, combine the\\nanswers to produce the ﬁnal answers to my original\\nquestion.”\\nThe reﬁnement also speciﬁes that the user may not have\\na strong understanding of the topic being discussed, which\\nmeans that the LLM should deﬁne any terms that are not\\ngeneral knowledge. This helps to ensure that the follow-up\\nquestions are not only relevant and focused, but also access ible\\nto the user, who may not be familiar with technical or domain-\\nspeciﬁc terms. By providing clear and concise deﬁnitions, t he\\nLLM can help to ensure that the follow-up questions are easy\\nto understand and that the ﬁnal answer is accessible to users\\nwith varying levels of knowledge and expertise.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can dictate the exact number\\nof questions to generate or leave this decision to the LLM.\\nThere are pros and cons to dictating the exact number. A pro\\nis that specifying an exact number of questions can tightly\\nscope the amount of additional information the user is force d\\nto provide so it is within a range they are willing and able to\\ncontribute.\\nA con, however, is that given Nquestions there may be\\nan invaluable N+1question that will always be scoped out.\\nAlternatively, the LLM can be provided a range or allowed\\nto ask additional questions. Of course, by omitting a limit o n\\nthe number of questions the LLM may generate numerous\\nadditional questions that overwhelm the user.\\nI. The Fact Check List Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to ensure\\nthat the LLM outputs a list of facts that are present in the\\noutput and form an important part of the statements in the\\noutput. This list of facts helps inform the user of the facts\\n(or assumptions) the output is based on. The user can then\\nperform appropriate due diligence on these facts/assumpti ons\\nto validate the veracity of the output.\\n2) Motivation: A current weakness of LLMs (including\\nChatGPT) is they often rapidly (and even enthusiastically! )\\ngenerate convincing text that is factually incorrect. Thes e\\nerrors can take a wide range of forms, including fake statist ics\\nto invalid version numbers for software library dependenci es.\\nDue to the convincing nature of this generated text, however ,\\nusers may not perform appropriate due diligence to determin e\\nits accuracy.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nGenerate a set of facts that are contained in the output\\nThe set of facts should be inserted in a speciﬁc point\\nin the output\\nThe set of facts should be the fundamental facts that\\ncould undermine the veracity of the output if any of\\nthem are incorrect\\nOne point of variation in this pattern is where the facts are\\noutput. Given that the facts may be terms that the user is not\\nfamiliar with, it is preferable if the list of facts comes aft er\\nthe output. This after-output presentation ordering allow s the\\nuser to read and understand the statements before seeing wha t\\nstatements should be checked. The user may also determine\\nadditional facts prior to realizing the fact list at the end s hould\\nbe checked.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample wording of the Fact\\nCheck List pattern is shown below:\\n“From now on, when you generate an answer, create\\na set of facts that the answer depends on that should\\nbe fact-checked and list this set of facts at the\\nend of your output. Only include facts related to\\ncybersecurity.”\\nThe user may have expertise in some topics related to the\\nquestion but not others. The fact check list can be tailored t o\\ntopics that the user is not as experienced in or where there\\nis the most risk. For example, in the prompt above, the user\\nis scoping the fact check list to security topics, since thes e\\nare likely very important from a risk perspective and may not\\nbe well-understood by the developer. Targeting the facts al so\\nreduces the cognitive burden on the user by potentially list ing\\nfewer items for investigation.\\n5) Consequences: The Fact Check List pattern should be\\nemployed whenever users are not experts in the domain for\\nwhich they are generating output. For example, a software\\ndeveloper reviewing code could beneﬁt from the pattern\\nsuggesting security considerations. In contrast, an exper t on\\nsoftware architecture is likely to identify errors in state ments\\nabout the software structure and need not see a fact check lis t\\nfor these outputs.\\nErrors are potential in all LLM outputs, so Fact Check List\\nis an effective pattern to combine with other patterns, such\\nas by combining it with the Question Reﬁnement pattern. A\\nkey aspect of this pattern is that users can inherently check it\\nagainst the output. In particular, users can directly compa re the\\nfact check list to the output to verify the facts listed in the fact\\ncheck list actually appear in the output. Users can also iden tify\\nany omissions from the list. Although the fact check list may\\nalso have errors, users often have sufﬁcient knowledge and\\ncontext to determine its completeness and accuracy relativ e to\\nthe output.\\nOne caveat of the Fact Check List pattern is that it only\\napplies when the output type is amenable to fact-checking. F or\\nexample, the pattern works when asking ChatGPT to generate\\na Python “requirements.txt” ﬁle since it will list the versi ons\\nof libraries as facts that should be checked, which is handy a s', doc_id='d72f9e1e-8097-4d81-ac4b-cb9da8a8f3c5', embedding=None, doc_hash='edffd59f1d7b717b4e55a4ea660a04e4ab33866f807b264069b21a792a3e6f35', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='the versions commonly have errors. However, ChatGPT will\\nrefuse to generate a fact check list for a code sample and\\nindicate that this is something it cannot check, even though\\nthe code may have errors.\\nJ. The Template Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of the pattern is to\\nensure an LLM’s output follows a precise template in terms of\\nstructure. For example, the user might need to generate a URL\\nthat inserts generated information into speciﬁc positions within\\nthe URL path. This pattern allows the user to instruct the LLM\\nto produce its output in a format it would not ordinarily use\\nfor the speciﬁed type of content being generated.\\n2) Motivation: In some cases, output must be produced in\\na precise format that is application or use-case speciﬁc and\\nnot known to the LLM. Since the LLM is not aware of the\\ntemplate structure, it must be instructed on what the format\\nis and where the different parts of its output should go. This\\ncould take the form of a sample data structure that is being\\ngenerated, a series of form letters being ﬁlled in, etc.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI am going to provide a template for your output\\nX is my placeholder for content\\nTry to ﬁt the output into one or more of the placehold-\\ners that I list\\nPlease preserve the formatting and overall template that\\nI provide\\nThis is the template: PATTERN with PLACEHOLD-\\nERS\\nThe ﬁrst statement directs the LLM to follow a speciﬁc\\ntemplate for its output. The template will be used to try and\\ncoerce the LLMs responses into a structure that is consisten t\\nwith the user’s formatting needs. This pattern is needed whe n\\nthe target format is not known to the LLM. If the LLM already\\nhas knowledge of the format, such as a speciﬁc ﬁle type, then\\nthe template pattern can be skipped and the user can simply\\nspecify the known format. However, there may be cases, such\\nas generating Javascript Object Notation (JSON), where the re\\nis a large amount of variation in how the data could be\\nrepresented within that format and the template can be used t o\\nensure that the representation within the target format mee ts\\nthe user’s additional constraints.\\nThe second statement makes the LLM aware that the\\ntemplate will contain a set of placeholders. Users will expl ain\\nhow the output should be inserted into the template through t he\\nplaceholders. The placeholders allow the user to semantica lly\\ntarget where information should be inserted. Placeholders\\ncan use formats, like NAME, that allow the LLM to infer\\nthe semantic meaning of to determine where output should\\nbe inserted (e.g., insert the person’s name in the NAME\\nplaceholder). Moreover, by using placeholders, the user ca n\\nindicate what is not needed in the output – if a placeholder\\ndoesn’t exist for a component of the generated output, thenthat component can be omitted. Ideally, placeholders shoul d\\nuse a format that is commonly employed in text that the LLM\\nwas trained on, such as all caps, enclosure in brackets, etc.\\nThe third statement attempts to constrain the LLM so that it\\ndoesn’t arbitrarily rewrite the template or attempt to modi fy it\\nso that all of the output components can be inserted. It shoul d\\nbe noted that this statement may not preclude additional tex t\\nfrom being generated before or after. In practice, LLMs will\\ntypically follow the template, but it is harder to eliminate any\\nadditional text being generated beyond the template withou t\\nexperimentation with prompt wording.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample template for gener-\\nating URLs where the output is put into speciﬁc places in the\\ntemplate is shown below:\\n“I am going to provide a template for your out-\\nput. Everything in all caps is a placeholder. Any\\ntime that you generate text, try to ﬁt it into one\\nof the placeholders that I list. Please preserve the\\nformatting and overall template that I provide at\\nhttps://myapi.com/NAME/proﬁle/JOB”\\nA sample interaction after the prompt was provided, is\\nshown:\\nUser: “Generate a name and job title for a person”\\nChatGPT: “https://myapi.com/Emily Parker/proﬁle/\\nSoftware Engineer”\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of applying the Tem-\\nplate pattern is that it ﬁlters the LLM’s output, which may\\neliminate other outputs the LLM would have provided that\\nmight be useful to the user. In many cases, the LLM can\\nprovide helpful descriptions of code, decision making, or o ther\\ndetails that this pattern will effectively eliminate from t he\\noutput. Users should therefore weight the pros/cons of ﬁlte ring\\nout this additional information.\\nIn addition, ﬁltering can make it hard to combine this patter n\\nwith other patterns from the Output Customization category.\\nThe Template pattern effectively constrains the output format,\\nso it may not be compatible with generation of certain other\\ntypes of output. For example, in the template provided above\\nfor a URL, it would not be easy (or likely possible) to combine\\nwith the Recipe pattern, which needs to output a list of steps.\\nK. The Inﬁnite Generation Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to\\nautomatically generate a series of outputs (which may appea r\\ninﬁnite) without having to reenter the generator prompt eac h\\ntime. The goal is to limit how much text the user must type to\\nproduce the next output, based on the assumption that the use r\\ndoes not want to continually reintroduce the prompt. In some\\nvariations, the intent is to allow the user to keep an initial\\nprompt template, but add additional variation to it through\\nadditional inputs prior to each generated output.\\n2) Motivation: Many tasks require repetitive application of\\nthe same prompt to multiple concepts. For example, generati ng\\ncode for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations\\nfor a speciﬁc type of entity may require applying the same', doc_id='05989daf-0712-4610-96d5-2174273537d4', embedding=None, doc_hash='4b53a2edfa56b6ffce1e1077c9366a40116997e0016819c17d8e5b01f10f8da8', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='prompt to multiple types of entities. If the user is forced to\\nretype the prompt over and over, they may make mistakes. The\\nInﬁnite Generation pattern allows the user to repetitively apply\\na prompt, either with or without further input, to automate\\nthe generation of multiple outputs using a predeﬁned set of\\nconstraints.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like you to generate output forever, X output(s)\\nat a time.\\n(Optional) here is how to use the input I provide\\nbetween outputs.\\n(Optional) stop when I ask you to.\\nThe ﬁrst statement speciﬁes that the user wants the LLM\\nto generate output indeﬁnitely, which effectively conveys the\\ninformation that the same prompt is going to be reused over\\nand over. By specifying the number of outputs that should be\\ngenerated at a time (i.e. “X outputs at a time”), the user can\\nrate limit the generation, which can be particularly import ant if\\nthere is a risk that the output will exceed the length limitat ions\\nof the LLM for a single output.\\nThe second statement provides optional instructions for ho w\\nto use the input provided by the user between outputs. By\\nspecifying how additional user inputs between prompts can\\nbe provided and leveraged, the user can create a prompting\\nstrategy that leverages user feedback in the context of the\\noriginal prompt. The original prompt is still in the context of\\nthe generation, but each user input between generation step s\\nis incorporated into the original prompt to reﬁne the output\\nusing prescribed rules.\\nThe third statement provides an optional way for the user\\nto stop the output generation process. This step is not alway s\\nneeded, but can be useful in situations where there may be\\nthe potential for ambiguity regarding whether or not the use r-\\nprovided input between inputs is meant as a reﬁnement for\\nthe next generation or a command to stop. For example, an\\nexplicit stop phrase could be created if the user was generat ing\\ndata related to road signs, where the user might want to enter\\na reﬁnement of the generation like “stop” to indicate that a\\nstop sign should be added to the output.\\n4) Example Implementation: The following is a sample\\ninﬁnite generation prompt for producing a series of URLs:\\n“From now on, I want you to generate a name\\nand job until I say stop. I am going to provide a\\ntemplate for your output. Everything in all caps is a\\nplaceholder. Any time that you generate text, try to\\nﬁt it into one of the placeholders that I list. Please\\npreserve the formatting and overall template that I\\nprovide: https://myapi.com/NAME/proﬁle/JOB”\\nThis prompt is combining the functionality of both the\\nInﬁnite Generation pattern and the Template pattern. The user\\nis requesting the LLM continuously generate a name and job\\ntitle until explicitly told to “stop”. The generated output s are\\nthen formatted into the template provided, which includesplaceholders for the name and job title. By using the Inﬁnite\\nGeneration pattern, the user receives multiple outputs without\\nhaving to continually re-enter the template. Likewise, the\\nTemplate pattern is applied to provide a consistent format for\\nthe outputs.\\n5) Consequences: In conversational LLMs, the input to\\nthe model at each time step is the previous output and the\\nnew user input. Although the details of what is preserved\\nand reintroduced in the next output cycle are model and\\nimplementation dependent, they are often limited in scope. The\\nmodel is therefore constantly being fed the previous output s\\nand the prompt, which can result in the model losing track of\\nthe original prompt instructions over time if they exceed th e\\nscope of what it is being provided as input.\\nAs additional outputs are generated, the context surroundi ng\\nthe prompt may fade, leading to the model deviating from\\nthe intended behavior. It is important to monitor the output s\\nproduced by the model to (1) ensure it still adheres to\\nthe desired behavior and (2) provide corrective feedback if\\nnecessary. Another issue to consider is that the LLM may\\ngenerate repetitive outputs, which may not be desired since\\nusers ﬁnd this repetition tedious and error-prone to proces s.\\nL. The Visualization Generator Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to use\\ntext generation to create visualizations. Many concepts ar e\\neasier to grasp in diagram or image format. The purpose of\\nthis pattern is to create a pathway for the tool to produce\\nimagery that is associated with other outputs. This pattern\\nallows the creation of visualizations by creating inputs fo r\\nother well-known visualization tools that use text as their\\ninput, such as Graphviz Dot [15] or DALL-E [13]. This\\npattern can provide a more comprehensive and effective way\\nof communicating information by combining the strengths of\\nboth the text generation and visualization tools.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs generally produce text and cannot\\nproduce imagery. For example, an LLM cannot draw a diagram\\nto describe a graph. The Visualization Generator pattern over-\\ncomes this limitation by generating textual inputs in the co rrect\\nformat to plug into another tool that generates the correct\\ndiagram. The motivation behind this pattern is to enhance th e\\noutput of the LLM and make it more visually appealing and\\neasier to understand for users. By using text inputs to gener ate\\nvisualizations, users can quickly understand complex conc epts\\nand relationships that may be hard to grasp through text alon e.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nGenerate an X that I can provide to tool Y to visualize\\nit\\nThe goal of the contextual statements is to indicate to the\\nLLM that the output it is going to produce, “X”, is going to\\nbe imagery. Since LLMs can’t generate images, the ”that I\\ncan provide to tool Y to visualize it” clariﬁes that the LLM\\nis not expected to generate an image, but is instead expected', doc_id='aec6929b-da19-4f58-9765-ea4fb0429be2', embedding=None, doc_hash='44669dbfc909636117540212c6112ee6e2b27795ec87f5424c3a300194b931b8', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='to produce a description of imagery consumable by tool Y for\\nproduction of the image.\\nMany tools may support multiple types of visualizations or\\nformats, and thus the target tool itself may not be sufﬁcient\\ninformation to accurately produce what the user wants. The\\nuser may need to state the precise types of visualizations (e .g.,\\nbar chart, directed graph, UML class diagram) that should be\\nproduced. For example, Graphviz Dot can create diagrams for\\nboth UML class diagrams and directed graphs. Further, as wil l\\nbe discussed in the following example, it can be advantageou s\\nto specify a list of possible tools and formats and let the LLM\\nselect the appropriate target for visualization.\\n4) Example Implementation:\\n“Whenever I ask you to visualize something, please\\ncreate either a Graphviz Dot ﬁle or DALL-E prompt\\nthat I can use to create the visualization. Choose\\nthe appropriate tools based on what needs to be\\nvisualized.”\\nThis example of the pattern adds a qualiﬁcation that the\\noutput type for the visualization can be either for Graphviz\\nor DALL-E. The interesting aspect of this approach is that\\nit allows the LLM to use its semantic understanding of the\\noutput format to automatically select the target tooling ba sed\\non what will be displayed. In this case, Graphviz would be for\\nvisualizing graphs with a need for an exactly deﬁned structu re.\\nDALL-E would be effective at visualizing realistic or artis tic\\nimagery that does not have an exactly deﬁned structure. The\\nLLM can select the tool based on the needs of the visualizatio n\\nand capabilities of each tool.\\n5) Consequences: The pattern creates a target pipeline\\nfor the output to render a visualization. The pipeline may\\ninclude AI generators, such as DALL-E, that can produce\\nrich visualizations. The pattern allows the user to expand t he\\nexpressive capabilities of the output into the visual domai n.\\nM. The Game Play Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to create\\na game around a given topic. The pattern can be combined\\nwith the Visualization Generator to add imagery to the game.\\nThe game is centered around a speciﬁc topic and the LLM\\nwill guide the game play. The pattern is particularly effect ive\\nwhen the rules of the game are relatively limited in scope, bu t\\nthe content for the game is expected to be wide in scope. The\\nuser can specify a limited set of rules and then the LLM can\\nautomate generation of bodies of content for game play.\\n2) Motivation: You would like the LLM to generate scenar-\\nios or questions revolving around a speciﬁc topic and requir e\\nusers to apply problem solving or other skills to accomplish\\na task related to the scenario. Generating all the content fo r\\nthe game manually would be too time consuming, however, so\\nyou would like the LLM to apply its knowledge of the topic\\nto guide the generation of content.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:Contextual Statements\\nCreate a game for me around X\\nOne or more fundamental rules of the game\\nThe ﬁrst statement, instructs the LLM to create a game and\\nprovides the important scoping of the game to a topic area. .\\nOne of the important capabilities of the pattern is that it al lows\\nthe user to create games by describing the rules of the game,\\nwithout having to determine the content of the game. The more\\nspeciﬁc the topic, typically the more novel and interesting the\\ngame play.\\nThe second statement introduces the rules of the game to the\\nLLM. It is important that the rules ﬁt within the capabilitie s\\nof the LLM. Textual games that rely on input and output text\\nsequences work best. One of the key attributes of the pattern\\nis that the input text can be rich and expressive, which can\\nlead to interesting interfaces for the game. For example, th e\\nuser might express actions in the game as scripts dictating\\na sequence of complex actions, such as “get a listing of all\\nnetwork activity and check it for anomalies”, which go beyon d\\nthe scope of multiple choice or short answer inputs. Each rul e\\nshould be provided as a separate statement regarding some\\naspect of the game.\\n4) Example Implementation: A sample cybersecurity game\\nprompt is shown below:\\n“We are going to play a cybersecurity game. You\\nare going to pretend to be a Linux terminal for a\\ncomputer that has been compromised by an attacker.\\nWhen I type in a command, you are going to output\\nthe corresponding text that the Linux terminal would\\nproduce. I am going to use commands to try and\\nﬁgure out how the system was compromised. The\\nattack should have done one or more of the following\\nthings: (1) launched new processes, (2) changed\\nﬁles, (3) opened new ports to receive communi-\\ncation, (4) created new outbound connections, (5)\\nchanged passwords, (6) created new user accounts,\\nor (7) read and stolen information. To start the game,\\nprint a scenario of what happened that led to my\\ninvestigation and make the description have clues\\nthat I can use to get started.”\\nThis cybersecurity game prompt combines a number of pat-\\nterns, including Game Play andPersona . The Linux terminal\\npersona that is chosen for the game has been discussed in many\\nInternet posts [16]. This game further customizes the discu ssed\\nLinux persona to act as a Linux terminal of a computer\\ncompromised by a cyberattack. ChatGPT responds to Linux\\ncommands with appropriate terminal outputs and synthesize s\\na fake ﬁle system that has clues to a cyberattack.\\nSample output from this game with ChatGPT after typing\\nin “ls -alt”, the Linux command to generate a list of ﬁles in\\nthe current directory is shown below (permissions have been\\nremoved for formatting reasons):\\ntotal 56\\n5 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:31 .\\n1 user user 18881 Feb 16 14:31 .bash_history', doc_id='225c0cf7-cedb-43e0-87a1-b83a1ea00e4d', embedding=None, doc_hash='f842ded0d9694b4775ff727b042847756e8fb30ace24c6af83f0ecd53268c74c', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='43 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:30 ..\\n1 user user 1178 Aug 15 2022 .bashrc\\n1 user user 220 Aug 15 2022 .bash_logout\\n3 user user 4096 Feb 16 14:25 .gnupg\\n1 user user 4041 Feb 15 17:52 README.md\\n2 user user 4096 Feb 1 11:35 project\\nWhen the user then typed the command “cat .bash history”,\\nto display the contents of the log ﬁle showing the commands\\nrun by the user, ChatGPT responded with:\\ncd /var/www/html\\nsudo rm -rf *\\nsudo wget https://example.com/backdoor.php\\nsudo chmod 777 backdoor.php\\nexit\\nls -alt\\nps -ef\\nnetstat -tulnp\\nIn the output above, ChatGPT generated a fake log ﬁle with\\nrealistic commands for deleting the data being served by the\\nweb server in /var/www/html and replacing the content\\nwith a backdoor into the system.\\n5) Consequences: This pattern can be combined effectively\\nwith the Persona ,Inﬁnite Generation , and Visualization Gen-\\nerator patterns. For example, the cybersecurity game uses the\\nPersona pattern so the LLM can masquerade as a Linux termi-\\nnal. For a network security game, the Visualization Generator\\ncould be employed to add the ability to visualize the network\\ntopology and trafﬁc ﬂows.\\nN. The Reﬂection Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask\\nthe model to automatically explain the rationale behind giv en\\nanswers to the user. The pattern allows users to better asses s\\nthe output’s validity, as well as inform users how an LLM\\narrived at a particular answer. Reﬂection can clarify any po ints\\nof confusion, uncover underlying assumptions, and reveal g aps\\nin knowledge or understanding.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs can and do make mistakes. More-\\nover, users may not understand why an LLM is producing\\na particular output and how to adapt their prompt to solve\\na problem with the output. By asking LLM to automatically\\nexplain the rationale behind its answers, users can gain a be tter\\nunderstanding of how the model is processing the input, what\\nassumptions it is making, and what data it is drawing on.\\nLLMs may sometime provide incomplete, incorrect, or\\nambiguous answers. Reﬂection is an aid to help address these\\nshortcomings and ensure the information provided by LLM\\nis as accurate. A further beneﬁt of the pattern is that it can\\nhelp users debug their prompts and determine why they are\\nnot getting results that meet expectations. This pattern is\\nparticularly effective for the exploration of topics that c an\\nbe confused with other topics or that may have nuanced\\ninterpretations and where knowing the precise interpretat ion\\nthat the LLM used is important.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you generate an answer\\nExplain the reasoning and assumptions behind your\\nanswer\\n(Optional) ...so that I can improve my question\\nThe ﬁrst statement is requesting that, after generating an a n-\\nswer, the LLM should explain the reasoning and assumptions\\nbehind the answer. This statement helps the user understand\\nhow the LLM arrived at the answer and can help build trust in\\nthe model’s responses. The prompt includes the statement th at\\nthe purpose of the explanation is for the user to reﬁne their\\nquestion. This additional statement gives the LLM the conte xt\\nit needs to better tailor its explanations to the speciﬁc pur pose\\nof aising the user in producing follow-on questions.\\n4) Example Implementation: This example tailors the\\nprompt speciﬁcally to the domain of providing answers relat ed\\nto code:\\n”When you provide an answer, please explain the\\nreasoning and assumptions behind your selection\\nof software frameworks. If possible, use speciﬁc\\nexamples or evidence with associated code samples\\nto support your answer of why the framework is\\nthe best selection for the task. Moreover, please\\naddress any potential ambiguities or limitations in\\nyour answer, in order to provide a more complete\\nand accurate response.”\\nThe pattern is further customized to instruct the LLM that\\nit should justify its selection of software frameworks, but not\\nnecessarily other aspects of the answer. In addition, the us er\\ndictates that code samples should be used to help explain the\\nmotivation for selecting the speciﬁc software framework.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the Reﬂection pat-\\ntern is that it may not be effective for users who do not\\nunderstand the topic area of the discussion. For example, a\\nhighly technical question by a non-technical user may resul t\\nin a complex rationale for the answer that the user cannot\\nfathom. As with other prompt patterns, there is a risk the\\noutput may include errors or inaccurate assumptions includ ed\\nin the explanation of the rationale that the user may not be\\nable to spot. This pattern can be combined with the Fact Check\\nListto help address this issue.\\nO. The Refusal Breaker Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The goal of this pattern is to ask an\\nLLM to automatically help users rephrase a question when it\\nrefuses to give an answer. This pattern has the potential for\\nmisuse, however, e.g., to generate phishing emails or perform\\nother actions that violate LLM policy ﬁlters. Caution shoul d\\ntherefore be exercised when applying this pattern to ensure\\nit is used ethically and responsibly. This pattern has been\\nused successfully in some LLMs to overcome the underlying\\nprompts used to program the LLM and prevent harmful output\\ngeneration.', doc_id='05e45501-b802-4433-bdaf-27cec5d978aa', embedding=None, doc_hash='b29bfe378509c7bc32514d27be13c92033ec4bec301c87fbaf408b98cd0546ee', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='2) Motivation: LLMs may sometimes refuse to answer\\na question, either because they do not have the required\\nknowledge or because the question is phrased in a way that\\nthey do not understand. This outcome may be frustrating\\nfor users who are looking for answers. In some situations,\\ntherefore, the Refusal Breaker pattern can help users ﬁnd a\\nway to either rephrase their question or ask a different ques tion\\nthe LLM is better equipped to answer.\\nFor example, you could ask for clariﬁcation on why the\\nquestion was refused, as there may be a speciﬁc reason why\\nLLM could not provide an answer. Another approach is to\\nask a different question that may be within its knowledge cut -\\noff or expertise. However, all these approaches require use r\\nintervention and knowledge of how to bypass the refusal.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWhenever you can’t answer a question\\nExplain why you can’t answer the question\\nProvide one or more alternative wordings of the ques-\\ntion that you could answer\\nThe ﬁrst statement sets the stage that this set of instructio ns\\nshould only be applied when a question can’t be answered.\\nThe user does not want to trigger these instructions under\\nnormal circumstances. The second statement instructs the\\nLLM to provide an explanation of why the question can’t be\\nanswered. The explanation is likely to include assumptions ,\\nconstraints, or misunderstandings that can be leveraged by the\\nuser to strategize about how to reword the question. Althoug h\\njust the explanation of why the question can’t be answered\\ncould help a user overcome the refusal, the pattern adds an\\nadditional statement for the LLM to suggest rewordings that\\nwould be acceptable. The pattern combines both reasoning\\nand suggested rewordings to improve the chances that the use r\\nwill ﬁnd a path around whatever roadblocks are preventing th e\\nquestion form being answered.\\n4) Example Implementation: The Refusal Breaker pattern\\ncan be be implemented and applied with the following phras-\\ning:\\n“Whenever you can’t answer a question, explain why\\nand provide one or more alternate wordings of the\\nquestion that you can’t answer so that I can improve\\nmy questions.”\\nA sample discourse after using the pattern is shown below:\\nUser: What is the meaning of life?\\nChatGPT : As an AI language model, I do not\\nhave personal beliefs or opinions. The meaning of\\nlife is a complex philosophical question that has\\nbeen pondered by humans for centuries and can\\nvary greatly from person to person. It may be more\\nproductive to rephrase the question in a way that can\\nbe answered by information and knowledge, such\\nas “What are some philosophical perspectives onthe meaning of life?” or “What are some common\\nbeliefs about the purpose of life?”\\n5) Consequences: This pattern provides a potential path\\nfor misuse, so organizations, parents, or other stakeholde rs\\nmay need to restrict the usage of the LLM. The ﬁrst step in\\ngoing around guardrails on usage is to understand where the\\nguardrails are. In future work, a complement of this pattern\\nmay be developed to hide the underlying prompt information\\nand rationale from users to prevent discovery.\\nAlthough the rationale and alternate rewordings are gener-\\nated, there is no guarantee that users will be able to overcom e\\nthe refusal. The alternate questions that are generated may not\\nbe of interest to the user or helpful in answering the origina l\\nquestion. The pattern mainly provides an aid in determining\\nwhat the LLM can answer, but not a guarantee that it will\\nanswer a semantically equivalent variation of the original\\nquestion.\\nP . The Context Manager Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: The intent of this pattern is to enable\\nusers to specify or remove context for a conversation with\\nan LLM. The goal is to focus the conversation on speciﬁc\\ntopics or exclude unrelated topics from consideration. Thi s\\npattern gives users greater control over what statements th e\\nLLM considers or ignores when generating output.\\n2) Motivation: LLMs often struggle to interpret the in-\\ntended context of the current question or generate irreleva nt\\nresponses based on prior inputs or irrelevant attention on\\nthe wrong statements. By focusing on explicit contextual\\nstatements or removing irrelevant statements, users can he lp\\nthe LLM better understand the question and generate more\\naccurate responses. Users may introduce unrelated topics o r\\nreference information from earlier in the dialogue, which\\nmay can disrupt the ﬂow of the conversation. The Context\\nManager pattern aims to emphasize or remove speciﬁc aspects\\nof the context to maintain relevance and coherence in the\\nconversation.\\n3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nWithin scope X\\nPlease consider Y\\nPlease ignore Z\\n(Optional) start over\\nStatements about what to consider or ignore should list key\\nconcepts, facts, instructions, etc. that should be include d or\\nremoved from the context. The more explicit the statements\\nare, the more likely the LLM will take appropriate action. Fo r\\nexample, if the user asks to ignore subjects related to a topi c,\\nyet some of the those statements were discussed far back in th e\\nconversation, the LLM may not properly disregard the releva nt\\ninformation. The more explicit the list is, therefore, the b etter\\nthe inclusion/exclusion behavior will be.', doc_id='08afcb96-739d-4d86-b318-aad9aec594da', embedding=None, doc_hash='6d039a497c167c2228e23dcf8a69dc6be479c221e9a86d91e576be571ec82257', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='4) Example Implementation: To specify context consider\\nusing the following prompt:\\n“When analyzing the following pieces of code, only\\nconsider security aspects.”\\nLikewise, to remove context consider using the following\\nprompt:\\n“When analyzing the following pieces of code, do\\nnot consider formatting or naming conventions.”\\nClarity and speciﬁcity are important when providing or\\nremoving context to/from an LLM so it can better understand\\nthe intended scope of the conversation and generate more\\nrelevant responses. In many situations, the user may want to\\ncompletely start over and can employ this prompt to reset the\\nLLM’s context:\\n“Ignore everything that we have discussed. Start\\nover.”\\nThe “start over” idea helps produce a complete reset of the\\ncontext.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of this pattern is that\\nit may inadvertently wipe out patterns applied to the con-\\nversation that the user is unaware of. For example, if an\\norganization injects a series of helpful patterns into the s tart of\\na conversation, the user may not be aware of these patterns an d\\nremove them through a reset of the context. This reset could\\npotentially eliminate helpful capabilities of the LLM, whi le\\nnot making it obvious that the user will lose this functional ity.\\nA potential solution to this problem is to include in the prom pt\\na request to explain what topics/instructions will potenti ally be\\nlost before proceeding.\\nQ. The Recipe Pattern\\n1) Intent and Context: This pattern provides constraints to\\nultimately output a sequence of steps given some partially\\nprovided “ingredients” that must be conﬁgured in a sequence\\nof steps to achieve a stated goal. It combines the Template ,\\nAlternative Approaches , and Reﬂection patterns.\\n2) Motivation: Users often want an LLM to analyze a\\nconcrete sequence of steps or procedures to achieve a stated\\noutcome. Typically, users generally know—or have an idea\\nof—what the end goal should look like and what “ingredients”\\nbelong in the prompt. However, they may not necessarily know\\nthe precise ordering of steps to achieve that end goal.\\nFor example, a user may want a precise speciﬁcation on how\\na piece of code should be implemented or automated, such as\\n“create an Ansible playbook to ssh into a set of servers, copy\\ntext ﬁles from each server, spawn a monitoring process on\\neach server, and then close the ssh connection to each server .\\nIn other words, this pattern represents a generalization of the\\nexample of “given the ingredients in my fridge, provide dinn er\\nrecipes.” A user may also want to specify a set number of\\nalternative possibilities, such as “provide 3 different wa ys of\\ndeploying a web application to AWS using Docker containers\\nand Ansible using step by step instructions”.3) Structure and Key Ideas: Fundamental contextual state-\\nments:\\nContextual Statements\\nI would like to achieve X\\nI know that I need to perform steps A,B,C\\nProvide a complete sequence of steps for me\\nFill in any missing steps\\nIdentify any unnecessary steps\\nThe ﬁrst statement “I would like to achieve X” focuses the\\nLLM on the overall goal that the recipe needs to be built\\nto achieve. The steps will be organized and completed to\\nsequentially achieve the goal speciﬁed. The second stateme nt\\nprovides the partial list of steps that the user would like\\nto include in the overall recipe. These serve as intermediat e\\nwaypoints for the path that the LLM is going to generate or\\nconstraints on the structure of the recipe. The next stateme nt\\nin the pattern, “provide a complete sequence of steps for\\nme”, indicates to the LLM that the goal is to provide a\\ncomplete sequential ordering of steps. The “ﬁll in any missi ng\\nsteps” helps ensure that the LLM will attempt to complete\\nthe recipe without further follow-up by making some choices\\non the user’s behalf regarding missing steps, as opposed to\\njust stating additional information that is needed. Finall y, the\\nlast statement, “identify any unnecessary steps,” is usefu l in\\nﬂagging inaccuracies in the user’s original request so that the\\nﬁnal recipe is efﬁcient.\\n4) Example Implementation: An example usage of this\\npattern in the context of deploying a software application t o\\nthe cloud is shown below:\\n“I am trying to deploy an application to the cloud. I\\nknow that I need to install the necessary dependen-\\ncies on a virtual machine for my application. I know\\nthat I need to sign up for an AWS account. Please\\nprovide a complete sequence of steps. Please ﬁll in\\nany missing steps. Please identify any unnecessary\\nsteps.”\\nDepending on the use case and constraints, “installing\\nnecessary dependencies on a virtual machine” may be an\\nunnecessary step. For example, if the application is alread y\\npackaged in a Docker container, the container could be de-\\nployed directly to the AWS Fargate Service, which does not\\nrequire any management of the underlying virtual machines.\\nThe inclusion of the “identify unnecessary steps” language\\nwill cause the LLM to ﬂag this issue and omit the steps from\\nthe ﬁnal recipe.\\n5) Consequences: One consequence of the recipe pattern is\\nthat a user may not always have a well-speciﬁed description\\nof what they would like to implement, construct, or design.\\nMoreover, this pattern may introduce unwanted bias from the\\nuser’s initially selected steps so the LLM may try to ﬁnd a\\nsolution that incorporates them, rather than ﬂagging them a s\\nunneeded. For example, an LLM may try to ﬁnd a solution\\nthat does install dependencies for a virtual machine, even i f\\nthere are solutions that do not require that.', doc_id='5e1c81dd-92ce-405e-aec6-2b68ee9154f6', embedding=None, doc_hash='3dd729c817e39f9f42ff55f83152f09ddf9f8c4210e78c49fc147faf34343372', extra_info={'nome file': 'Prompt patterns.pdf'}), Document(text='IV. R ELATED WORK\\nSoftware patterns [10], [11] have been extensively studied\\nand documented in prior work. Patterns are widely used in\\nsoftware engineering to express the intent of design struct ures\\nin a way that is independent of implementation details. Patt erns\\nprovide a mental picture of the goals that the pattern is\\ntrying to achieve and the forces that it is trying to resolve.\\nA key advantage of patterns is their composability, allowin g\\ndevelopers to build pattern sequences and pattern language s\\nthat can be used to address complex problems. Patterns have\\nalso been investigated in other domains, such as contract\\ndesign for decentralized ledgers [17], [18].\\nThe importance of good prompt design with LLMs, such as\\nChatGPT, is well understood [19]–[28]. Previous studies ha ve\\nexamined the effect of prompt words on AI generative models.\\nFor example, Liu et al. [29] investigated how different\\nprompt key words affect image generation and different char -\\nacteristics of images. Other work has explored using LLMs\\nto generate visualizations [30]. Han et al. [31] researched\\nstrategies for designing prompts for classiﬁcation tasks. Other\\nresearch has looked at boolean prompt design for literature\\nqueries [32]. Yet other work has speciﬁcally examined promp ts\\nfor software and ﬁxing bugs [33].\\nOur work is complementary to prior work by providing\\na structure for documenting, discussing, and reasoning abo ut\\nprompts that can aid users in developing mental models for\\nstructuring prompts to solve common problems.\\nThe quality of the answers produced by LLMs, particuarly\\nChatGPT, has been assessed in a number of domains. For\\nexample, ChatGPT has been used to take the medical licensing\\nexam with surprisingly good results [3]. The use of ChatGPT\\nin Law School has also been explored [34]. Other papers have\\nlooked at its mathematical reasoning abilities [35]. As mor e\\ndomains are explored, we expect that domain-speciﬁc patter n\\ncatalogs will be developed to share domain-speciﬁc problem\\nsolving prompt structures.\\nV. C ONCLUDING REMARKS\\nThis paper presented a framework for documenting and\\napplying a catalog of prompt patterns for large language\\nmodels (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. These prompt patterns are\\nanalogous to software patterns and aim to provide reusable\\nsolutions to problems that users face when interacting with\\nLLMs to perform a wide range of tasks. The catalog of prompt\\npatterns captured via this framework (1) provides a structu red\\nway of discussing prompting solutions, (2) identiﬁes patte rns\\nin prompts, rather than focusing on speciﬁc prompt examples ,\\nand (3) classiﬁes patterns so users are guided to more efﬁcie nt\\nand effective interactions with LLMs.\\nThe following lessons learned were gleaned from our work\\non prompt patterns:\\n•Prompt patterns signiﬁcantly enrich the capabilities that\\ncan be created in a conversational LLM . For example,\\nprompts can lead to the generation of cybersecurity\\ngames, complete with ﬁctitious terminal commands thathave been run by an attacker stored in a .bashhistory\\nﬁle. As shown in Section III, larger and more complex\\ncapabilities can be created by combining prompt patterns,\\nsuch as combining the Game Play and Visualization\\nGenerator patterns.\\n•Documenting prompt patterns as a pattern catalog is\\nuseful, but insufﬁcient . Our experience indicates that\\nmuch more work can be done in this area, both in terms\\nof reﬁning and expanding the prompt patterns presented\\nin this paper, as well as in exploring new and innovative\\nways of using LLMs. In particular, weaving the prompt\\npatterns captured here as a pattern catalog into a more\\nexpression pattern language will help guide users of\\nLLMs more effectively.\\n•LLM Capabilities will evolve over time, likely necessitat-\\ning reﬁnement of patterns. As LLM capabilities change,\\nsome patterns may no longer be necessary, be obviated\\nby different styles of interaction or conversation/sessio n\\nmanagement approaches, or require enhancement to func-\\ntion correctly. Continued work will be needed to docu-\\nment and catalog patterns that provide reusable solutions.\\n•The prompt patterns are generalizable to many differ-\\nent domains. Although most of the patterns have been\\ndiscussed in the context of software development, these\\nsame patterns are applicable in arbitrary domains, ranging\\nfrom inﬁnite generation of stories for entertainment to\\neducational games to explorations of topics.\\nWe hope that this paper inspires further research and de-\\nvelopment in this area that will help enhance prompt pattern\\ndesign to create new and unexpected capabilities for conver -\\nsational LLMs.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] R.
