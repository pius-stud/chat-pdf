# Chat-pdf

This repository contains the python scripts that i used to create a ChatBot on VSCode.\
The ChatBot was made using the LLM from OpenAI "gpt-3.5-turbo" and also thanks to the python libraries Langchain and Llama-index.\
\
Thanks to these script is possible to load more PDF files and to query the ChatBot in order to obtain information about them.\
This is done creating indexes (and/or a graph) from each pdf file that can be queried.
